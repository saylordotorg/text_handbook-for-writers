        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing as a College Student</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s00_p01">As a college student, you have been writing for years, so you probably think that you have a clear understanding about academic writing. High school and college writing, however, differ in many ways. This chapter will present some of those core differences along with a general overview of the college writing process.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p01">If you’re like most first-year college students, you’re probably anxious about your first few writing assignments. Transitioning from being a successful high school writer to being a quality college writer can be difficult. You have to adjust to different learning cultures. You have to accept that college writing is different from high school writing and come to understand how it is different.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p02">These students relay a typical range of first-year college experiences:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p03">Emma: I always got As on my high school papers, so I thought I was a good writer until I came to college and had to completely rewrite my first paper to get a C–.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p04">Javier: I received an F on my first college paper because I “did not include one original thought in the whole paper.” I thought I was reporting on information I had researched. I didn’t know that I was supposed to add my own thoughts. Luckily, the professor had a policy to throw out each student’s lowest grade of the semester.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl03">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p05">Danyell: The professor in my Comp 101 class said that he didn’t want us turning in anything meaningless or trite. He said that we were to show him that we had critical thought running through our heads and knew how to apply it to the readings we found in our research. I had no idea what he was talking about.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl04">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p06">Pat: I dreaded my first college English class since I had never done well in English classes in high school. Writing without grammatical and mechanical errors is a challenge for me, and my high school teachers always gave me low grades on my papers due to all my mistakes. So I was surprised when I got a B+ on my first college paper, and the professor had written, “Great paper! You make a solid argument. Clean up your grammar and mechanics next time and you will get an A!” Suddenly it seemed that there was something more important than grammar and punctuation!</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Despite the seeming discrepancy between what high school and college teachers think constitutes good college writing, there is an overall consensus about what is “higher” about higher education.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s01_p02">Thinking with flexibility, depth, awareness, and understanding, as well as focusing on how you think, are some of the core building blocks that make higher education “higher.” These thinking methods coupled with perseverance, independence, originality, and a personal sense of mission are core values of higher education.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Differences between High School and College Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s02_p01">The difference between high school and college culture is like the difference between childhood and adulthood. Childhood is a step-by-step learning process. Adulthood is an independent time when you use the information you learned in childhood. In high school culture, you were encouraged to gather knowledge from teachers, counselors, parents, and textbooks. As college students, you will rely on personal assistance from authorities less and less as you learn to analyze texts and information independently. You will be encouraged to collaborate with others, but more to discuss ideas and concepts critically than to secure guidance.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">How the Writing Process Differs in College</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s03_p01">It’s important to understand that no universal description of either high school or college writing exists. High school teachers might concentrate on skills they want their students to have before heading to college: knowing how to analyze (often literary) texts, to develop the details of an idea, and to organize a piece of writing, all with solid mechanics. A college teacher might be more concerned with developing students’ ability to think, discuss, and write on a more abstract, interdisciplinary level. But there are exceptions, and debates rage on about where high school writing ends and college writing begins.</p>

                <li>Requirements and expectations for high school and college writing vary greatly from high school to high school and college to college.</li>
                <li>Some general differences, however, are fairly consistent: College students are expected to function more independently than high school students are. College students are encouraged to think with a deep awareness, to develop a clear sense of how they think, and to think on a more abstract level.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_p01">As a college student, you must take complete responsibility for your writing assignments. Your professors are assessing your ability to think for yourself, so they’re less likely to give you ready-made templates on how to write a given essay. This lack of clarity will be unsettling, but it’s part of an important growth process. By using strategies, you can systematically approach each assignment and gather the information you need for your writing requirements.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Plotting a Course for Your Writing Project</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s01_p01">Once you know you have an upcoming writing project, you have some basic decisions to make. The following list of questions will lead you to make some preliminary choices for your writing project. (To learn more, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05#mccrimmon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Planning"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05_s03#mccrimmon-ch05_s03">Section 5.3 "Developing Your Purposes for Writing"</a>.)</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What am I trying to accomplish?</strong> Writing can serve a variety of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">purposes</a><span class="glossdef">A writer’s reason for writing (e.g., to inform, to entertain).</span></span>, such as to explain, to persuade, to describe, to entertain, or to compare. Your assignment might specifically dictate the purpose of the writing project. Or the assignment might simply indicate, for example, that you are to show you understand a topic. In such a situation, you would then be free to choose a writing purpose through which you could demonstrate your understanding.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Who do I want my readers to be?</strong> Traditionally the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audience</a><span class="glossdef">The people to whom a piece of communication is directed.</span></span> for a college student’s paper has been the instructor, but technology is rapidly changing that. Many instructors actively make use of the web’s collaborative opportunities. Your fellow students (or even people outside the class) may now be your audience, and this will change how you approach your assignment. Even if your instructor is the only person who will see your finished product, you have the right (and even the responsibility) to identify an ideal reader or readership for your work. Whoever your audience is, take care to avoid writing too far above or too far beneath their knowledge or interest level.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What am I writing about?</strong> Your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic</a><span class="glossdef">The content area of a piece of communication.</span></span> might be set by your instructor. If so, make sure you know if you have the option of writing about different angles of the topic. If the topic is not preset, choose a topic in which you will be happy to immerse yourself.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What’s my position on this topic?</strong> Analyze your ideas and opinions before you start the writing project, especially if the assignment calls for you to take a position. Leave room for new ideas and changes in your opinion as you research and learn about the topic. Keep in mind that taking a stand is important in your efforts to write a paper that is truly yours rather than a compilation of others’ ideas and opinions, but the stand you take should evolve from encounters with the opinions of others. Monitor your position as you write your first draft, and attend to how it changes over the course of your writing and reading. If your purpose is to compare ideas and opinions on a given topic, clarifying your opinion may not be so critical, but remember that you are still using an interpretive point of view even when you are “merely” summarizing or analyzing data.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How long does this piece of writing need to be? How much depth should I go into?</strong> Many assignments have a predetermined range of page numbers, which somewhat dictates the depth of the topic. If no guidance is provided regarding length, it will be up to you to determine the scope of the writing project. Discussions with other students or your instructor might be helpful in making this determination.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How should I format this piece of writing?</strong> In today’s digital world, you have several equally professional options for completing and presenting your writing assignments. Unless your professor dictates a specific method for awareness and learning purposes, you will probably be free to make these format choices. Even your choice of font can be significant.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How or where will I publish this piece of writing?</strong> You are “publishing” every time you place an essay on a course management system or class-wide <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wiki</a><span class="glossdef">An interactive, shared website featuring content that can be edited by many users.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">blog</a><span class="glossdef">Short for weblog, a regularly posted entry on the web, and usually managed by a single person or a group of like-minded writers.</span></span>, or even when you present an essay orally. More likely than not, if your writing means something to you, you will want to share it with others beyond your instructor in some manner. Knowing how you will publish your work will affect some of the choices you make during the writing process.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How should my writing look beyond questions of format and font?</strong> College essays used to be completely devoid of visuals. Nowadays, given the ease of including them, an essay that does not include visuals might be considered weak. On the other hand, you do not want to include a visual just for the sake of having one. Every visual must be carefully chosen for its value-adding capacity. (To learn more about visuals, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch09#mccrimmon-ch09">Chapter 9 "Designing"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch09_s03#mccrimmon-ch09_s03">Section 9.3 "Incorporating Images, Charts, and Graphs"</a>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s01_p02">Planning the basics for your essay ahead of time will help assure proper organization for both the process and the product. It is almost a certainty that an unorganized process will lead to an unorganized product.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Reading Assignments Closely and Critically</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02_p01">A close and careful reading of any given writing assignment will help you sort out the ideas you want to develop in your writing assignment and make sense of how any assigned readings fit with the required writing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02_p02">Use the following strategies to make the most of every writing assignment you receive:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>Look for key words, especially verbs such as <em class="emphasis">analyze</em>, <em class="emphasis">summarize</em>, <em class="emphasis">evaluate</em>, or <em class="emphasis">argue</em>, in the assignment itself that will give clues to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">genre</a><span class="glossdef">A type of communication determined by its function with formal characteristics and conventions developed over time.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">structure</a><span class="glossdef">The form or organization of a piece of writing.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">medium</a><span class="glossdef">The means through which a message is transmitted.</span></span> of writing required.</li>
            <li>Do some prewriting that establishes your base of knowledge and your initial opinions about the subject if the topic is predetermined. Make a list of ideas you will need to learn more about in order to complete the assignment.</li>
            <li>Develop a list of possible ideas you could pursue if the topic is more open. (For more about choosing a topic, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05#mccrimmon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Planning"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05_s01#mccrimmon-ch05_s01">Section 5.1 "Choosing a Topic"</a>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02_p03">Use the following strategies to help you make the most of readings that support the writing assignment:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02_l02">
            <li>Make a note if you question something in any assigned reading related to the writing assignment.</li>
            <li>Preview each reading assignment by jotting down your existing opinions about the topic before reading. As you read, monitor whether your preconceived opinions prevent you from giving the text a fair reading. After finishing the text, check for changes in your opinions as result of your reading.</li>
            <li>Mark the locations of different opinions in your readings, so you can easily revisit them. (For more on how this works with research, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07#mccrimmon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Researching"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07_s08#mccrimmon-ch07_s08">Section 7.8 "Creating an Annotated Bibliography"</a>.)</li>
            <li>Note the points in your readings that you consider most interesting and most useful. Consider sharing your thoughts on the text in class discussions.</li>
            <li>Note any inconsistencies or details in your readings with which you disagree. Plan to discuss these details with other students or your professor.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s02_p04">Above all, when questions or concerns arise as you apply these strategies, take them up with your professor directly, either in class or during office hours. Making contact with your professor by asking substantive questions about your reading and writing helps you stand out from the crowd and demonstrates that you are an engaged student.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Connecting Your Reading with Your Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s03_p01">College writing often requires the use of others’ opinions and ideas to support, compare, and ground your opinions. You read to understand others’ opinions; you write to express your opinions in the context of what you’ve read. Remember that your writing must be just that—yours. Take care to use others’ opinions and ideas only as support. Make sure your ideas create the core of your writing assignments. (For more on documentation, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22#mccrimmon-ch22" xrefstyle="select: title">Chapter 22 "Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22_s05#mccrimmon-ch22_s05">Section 22.5 "Developing a List of Sources"</a>.)</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sharing and Testing Your Thinking with Others</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s04_p01">Discussion and debate are mainstays of a college education. Sharing and debating ideas with instructors and other students allows all involved to learn from each other and grow. You often enter into a discussion with your opinions and exit with a widened viewpoint. Although you can read an assignment and generate your understandings and opinions without speaking to another person, you would be limiting yourself by those actions. Instead it is in your best interest to share your opinions and listen to or read others’ opinions on a steady, ongoing basis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s04_p02">In order to share your ideas and opinions in a scholarly way, you must properly prepare your knowledge bank. Reading widely and using the strategies laid out in the <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s03">Section 11.2.3 "Connecting Your Reading with Your Writing"</a> are excellent methods for developing that habit.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s02_s04_p03">Make sure to maintain fluidity in your thoughts and opinions. Be prepared to make adjustments as you learn new ideas through discussions with others or through additional readings. You can discuss and debate in person or online, in real time or asynchronously. One advantage to written online discussions and debates is that you have an archived copy for later reference, so you don’t have to rely on memory. For this reason, some instructors choose to develop class sites for student collaboration, discussion, and debate.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_p01">How do you feel about group projects in your college classes? Are you like many students who resist group projects because you prefer to work alone? Do you know why college-level work often requires collaboration and how that collaborative work might be conducted differently than how it’s done in a K–12 environment?</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Different Types of Group Work</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s01_p01">You might not think of a typical writing assignment as a group project, but you begin collaborating on a writing assignment the moment you discuss your topic with someone else. From there, you might ask classmates to read your paper and share their opinions or to proofread your work. Some students form study groups to assure they have reviewers for their work and to have a collaborative atmosphere in which to work. These are just a few examples of effective college students voluntarily engaging in collaboration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s01_p02">Choosing to collaborate is not always left up to you, since some instructors often require it, whether through simple <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">group discussion boards</a><span class="glossdef">A feature of course management systems that allows students to post entries in response to discussion questions.</span></span> or through more complex interactions, such as a semester-long project. Whether or not it starts out as something that’s required, or “part of your grade” for the course, collaboration is something successful college students eventually learn to do on their own.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s01_p03">If your instructor gives you a collaborative writing assignment, don’t assume the worst possible outcome, where one or two people end up doing all the work. Decide and document who will do what and when it will happen. As a group, you are taking on nearly total responsibility for the project when you are involved in a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">collaborative learning</a><span class="glossdef">An educational method that requires groups of students to take nearly complete responsibility for organizing and scheduling their work together.</span></span> situation. Because of their complexity, collaborative writing projects still tend to be fairly uncommon, but they are becoming increasingly popular ways of developing and testing your collective ability to think, work, and communicate interdependently as part of a team—certainly an essential skill in the workplace.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Dynamics of Interpersonal Communication</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s02_p01">If collaboration is required, making a plan at the beginning of the assignment is essential. Decide if you will meet in person, online, or both. If the level of collaboration is at the reviewing and proofreading level, agree on a date to turn in or post drafts for review and set a clear timeline for completing reviews. For more involved collaborative efforts, such as a joint paper or project, begin by agreeing on a vision for the overall project. Then set up a schedule and split up the work evenly and equally, but with a sense of strategy as well. Figure out each other’s strengths and play to them. Make sure the schedule allows for plenty of time to regroup in case a group member does not meet a deadline.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s02_p02">During group meetings, discuss the direction and scope of the overall project as well as individual components. If any group members are struggling with their parts of the project, keep in mind that the success of all depends on the success of each, so meet to address problems. When group members disagree—and there will almost always be some differences of opinion—talk through the problems with a willingness to compromise while being careful to protect the overall integrity of the assignment. Choose an individual deadline for completion that allows time for all group members to read through the draft and suggest further revisions. If your project includes a presentation, make sure to leave time to plan that as well. Decide if one or more people will present and schedule at least one practice session to assure the group members are happy with the final presentation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">General Group Work Guidelines</h2>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make sure the overall plan is clear.</strong> A group project will only come together if all group members are working toward the same end product. Before beginning to write, make sure the complete plans are fleshed out and posted in writing on the group website, if one is available. Within the plan, include each member’s responsibilities.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Keep an open mind.</strong> You will undoubtedly have your ideas, but listen to other ideas and be willing to accept them if they make sense. Be flexible. Don’t insist on doing everything your way. Be tolerant. Hold back from criticizing others’ errors in an insulting way. Feel free to suggest alternatives, but always be polite. If you think someone is criticizing you unfairly or too harshly, let it go. Retaliating can create an ongoing problem that gets in the way of the project’s completion.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be diplomatic.</strong> Even if you think a coparticipant has a lousy idea and you are sure you have a better idea, you need to broach the topic very diplomatically. Keep in mind that if you want your opinion to have a fair hearing, you’ll need to present it in a way that is nonoffensive.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pay attention.</strong> Make sure you know what others are saying. Ask for clarification when needed. If you are unsure what someone means, restate it in your words and ask if your understanding is correct.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Be timely.</strong> Don’t make your coparticipants wait for you. As a group, agree to your timing in writing and then do your part to honor the timeline. Allow each person ample time to complete his or her part. Tight schedules often result in missed deadlines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Managing Consistency of Tone and Effort in Group Projects</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s04_p01">Human nature seems to naturally repel suggestions of change from others. It is wise to remember, however, that no one is a perfect writer. So it is in your best interest to welcome and at least consider others’ ideas without being defensive. Guard against taking feedback personally by keeping in mind that the feedback is about the words in your paper, not about you. Also show appreciation for the time your classmate took to review your paper. If you do not completely understand a suggestion from a classmate, keep in mind the “two heads are better than one” concept and take the time to follow up and clarify. In keeping with the reality that it is your paper, in the end, make only the changes with which you agree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s04_p02">When you review the work of others, keep the spirit of the following “twenty questions” in mind. Note that this is not a simple checklist; the questions are phrased to prevent “yes” or “no” answers. By working through these questions, you will develop a very good understanding about ways to make the writer’s draft better. You’ll probably also come up with some insights about your draft in the process. In fact, you’re welcome to subject your draft to the same review process.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s04_p03">When you have an idea that you think will help the writer, either explain your idea in a comment box or actually change the text to show what you mean. Of course, only change the text if you are using a format that will allow the author to have copies of both his or her original text and your changed version. If you are working with a hard copy, make your notes in the margins. Make sure to explain your ideas clearly and specifically, so they will be most helpful. Do not, for example, note only that a sentence is in the wrong place. Indicate where you think the sentence should be. If a question comes into your mind while you are reading the paper, include the question in the margin.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Assessing the Quality of Group Projects</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s05_p01">Instructors assess group projects differently than individual projects. Logically, instructors attribute an individual assignment’s merits, or lack thereof, completely to the individual. It is not as easy to assess students fairly on what they contributed individually to the merits of a group project, though wikis and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">course management systems</a><span class="glossdef">A web-based learning environment that organizes the work of a course (e.g., Blackboard).</span></span> are making individual work much easier to trace. Instructors may choose to hold the members of a team accountable for an acceptable overall project. Beyond that, instructors may rely on team members’ input about their group for additional assessment information.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s05_p02">For an in-depth collaborative project, your instructor is likely to ask all students in the group to evaluate their own performance, both as individuals and as part of the larger group. You might be asked to evaluate each individual group member’s contributions as well as the overall group efforts. This evaluation is an opportunity to point out the strong and weak points of your group, not a time to discuss petty disagreements or complain about group plans that did not go your way. Think about how you would feel if group members complained about your choices they did not like, and you can easily see the importance of being flexible, honest, and professional with group evaluations. For a clear understanding of how an instructor will grade a specific collaborative assignment, talk to the instructor.</p>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s03_s05_l02">
                <li>If the writing course in which you are currently enrolled is not using a wiki, write a rationale to your instructor for how the course might benefit from having such a collaborative platform. (Check out two of the most popular wikis for which free educational versions are currently available: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wikispaces.com">http://www.wikispaces.com</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbworks.com">http://www.pbworks.com</a>.) Include an evaluative comparison in your proposal and suggest to your class and instructor which would be the best to use for your writing course and why. Make sure you take into account how you would observe the syllabus and assignments currently in place for your course, and consider how they might be adjusted to meet the demands of a more collaborative context.</li>
                <li>As part of your proposal, you could set up a free wiki online and create a one-page essay explaining the process of setting up a free wiki. Publish your essay in your wiki and then give the rest of the class and your instructor permission to see your essay. If your writing course is already using a wiki, consider how you would draw up a similar proposal to an instructor in another discipline. For example, how would a history, biology, psychology, business, or nursing course benefit from a wiki?</li>
                <li>Choose an essay you have written for a previous assignment in class. Exchange the paper with a classmate. If possible, exchange an electronic version rather than a hard copy. Answer each of the “Twenty Questions for Peer Review” in this section. When necessary, make notes in the margins of the paper (by using Insert Comment if you are working in Word, then resaving the draft before returning it electronically).</li>
