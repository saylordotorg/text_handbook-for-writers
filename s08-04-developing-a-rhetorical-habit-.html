            <li>Get into the habit of thinking about the all texts in rhetorical terms.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s04_p01">The habit of thinking rhetorically starts with being comfortable enough with the rhetorical triangle to see it in practically every form of communication you produce and consume—not only those you encounter in academic settings but also those you encounter in everyday life. In several other chapters, you will make use of the elements (corners) and relationships (sides) of the rhetorical triangle, as well as the appeals associated with it. In <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05#mccrimmon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Planning"</a>, you’ll see how to use the triangle in more detail to build a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">statement of purpose</a><span class="glossdef">A tool for developing your purposes for a writing project, specifically your message, audience, voice, attitude, reception, and tone.</span></span> for specific writing projects by completing the following statements and returning to them as circumstances in your writing process change:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s04_p02">In <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07#mccrimmon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Researching"</a> and <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch08#mccrimmon-ch08">Chapter 8 "Revising"</a>, you’ll learn how to use the rhetorical triangle and the statement of purpose to plan and refine your research agenda, and in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch12#mccrimmon-ch12">Chapter 12 "Professional Writing"</a>, you’ll even see how to apply these rhetorical tools to a job search.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s04_p03">Besides familiarizing yourself with the elements of the triangle and how they function, you’ll also need to consider the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetorical moves</a><span class="glossdef">An array of creative, metaphorical, and humorous techniques used by writers who have developed a rhetorical habit of mind.</span></span> writers make so you can begin to use language more creatively in your writing. Good writers learn to improvise with the language, to make it work both as a tool for thinking and as a vehicle for communication. Here are four categories of rhetorical moves you will encounter and begin to use as you develop a rhetorical habit of mind.</p>

Set one goal for yourself in each of these categories and outline how you intend to reach that goal by the end of your first year of college:</p>
