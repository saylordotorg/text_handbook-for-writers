    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s02_p01">What if all coffee makers worked the same way, all vehicles had the exact same dashboard setup, and all verbs followed the exact same format? Life would simply be easier all the way around! But we live in a world of variety, and just as you take the needed steps to become familiar with the coffee maker and car you own, you should also take the effort to become familiar with the language you speak. This section presents an overview of common issues that impede the proper use of English verbs. To get ready to understand the possible problems, study the following chart that shows the five main forms of verbs. Notice that for verbs other than <em class="emphasis">be</em>, the present tense for all but third-person singular pronouns is the base verb (third-person singular uses the base verb + -<em class="emphasis">s</em>). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">present participle</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form created to indicate continuing action by adding present tense form of “to be” to the base verb + -<em class="emphasis">ing</em> (e.g., “We <em class="emphasis">are laughing</em>”).</span></span> is usually a form of “to be” + the base word + -<em class="emphasis">ing</em>, and the past tense and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">past participle</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form created to indicate completed action by adding past tense form of “to have” to the conjugated base verb (e.g., “They <em class="emphasis">had eaten</em>”).</span></span> follow irregular patterns.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s02_s02_p01">Some verbs are especially problematic either because their meanings are confused or because some of their forms sound alike. Handle these verbs by knowing which ones give you trouble and then focusing on the conjugation of those specific verbs. Some of these most commonly troublesome verbs are in the following table. You need to know two key verb types to read this table: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transitive</a><span class="glossdef">A type of verb that acts on a direct object (e.g., “He <em class="emphasis">hit</em> the ball”).</span></span> (when an object receives the action of the verb; in other words, something is done to something) and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intransitive</a><span class="glossdef">A type of verb that does not take a direct object (e.g., “He <em class="emphasis">laughs</em>”).</span></span> (a verb that does not act on an object).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s02_s05_p01">Verbals are words formed from verbs that function as other parts of speech. One type of verbals, gerunds (laughing, eating), always function as nouns (e.g., “<em class="emphasis">Laughing</em> is good for you”). Present, past, and present perfect participles are verbals that function as adjectives (e.g., “The sound of <em class="emphasis">laughing</em> children always cheered him up,” “The sight of the <em class="emphasis">broken</em> tricycle left in the rain made him gloomy”). Infinitives (to laugh, to have eaten) are another main type of verbals that function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. When using any of these verbals, make sure you match the tense of the verb in the sentence.</p>

                    <li>Verbs have twelve tenses that indicate different timings. Due to the complexity of the complete set of tenses, you simply have to memorize the uses for the different tenses and the methods of constructing each.</li>
