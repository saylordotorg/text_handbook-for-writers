        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_l01">
            <li>Understand the value of varied sentence lengths within a body of text.</li>

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_p01">Text written with only one type of sentence is boring for readers. To make your texts more interesting, you should use sentences of varying lengths, with different openings and endings, and with a variety of structures.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Featuring Short Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p01">Short sentences, when not overused, can be used to emphasize an idea and catch a reader’s attention. Notice how the ideas expressed through the following short sentences grab your attention more than the same ideas do when embedded in longer sentences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ideas separated into shorter sentences:</strong> My mother wants me to spend next weekend with her and my two aunts. They all talk nonstop. I am sure I would be nothing more than a fly on the wall while they talk about all the family members. I am simply not going!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ideas embedded in longer sentences:</strong> My mother wants me to spend next weekend with her and my two aunts who all talk nonstop. I am sure I would be nothing more than a fly on the wall while they talk about all the family members, so I am simply not going!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p04">But you need to be careful to choose your short sentences strategically so that they carry emphasis without making your writing appear unsophisticated. A third option might be to use one longer sentence and break up the other one into two shorter sentences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Combining Short Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_p01">Since an abundance of short sentences will give a simplistic appearance to your writing, you don’t want to use an excessive number of them close together. You can combine short sentences as a means of explaining an idea or a connection between two ideas. When you combine two complete sentences, you have to choose to either subordinate one of the ideas to the other or coordinate the two ideas by giving them equal weight. Your choice should always reflect the intended emphasis and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">causality</a><span class="glossdef">The relationship between the cause of an action and its effect (e.g., “The food spoiled because I left the freezer door open last night”).</span></span> of the two initial sentences.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Example</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Two short sentences:</strong> My television is broken. It is Karen’s fault.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Sentence combination that maintains intended emphasis and causality:</strong> Because of Karen, my television is broken.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Incorporating Sentences of Varying Lengths</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p01">Text of varying lengths is easier to read than text where the sentences are all about the same length. A whole page of extremely long sentences is overwhelming. Try reading a high-level academic paper on a scientific topic. The sentences are often long and involved, which results in difficult reading. A whole page of very short sentences, on the other hand, is choppy and seems unsophisticated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p02">Consider the following text that begins the first chapter of Mark Twain’s <em class="emphasis">A Tramp Abroad</em>. Twain begins with a long sentence (thirty-three words), follows with a medium-length sentence (seventeen words), and closes with two short sentences (six and five words, respectively). This mix of sentence lengths creates text that flows smoothly and is easy to read.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p03">One day it occurred to me that it had been many years since the world had been afforded the spectacle of a man adventurous enough to undertake a journey through Europe on foot. After much thought, I decided that I was a person fitted to furnish to mankind this spectacle. So I determined to do it. This was in March, 1878.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p04">Now read a different version of the same paragraph. Notice how the short sentences sound choppy and juvenile.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p05">I was thinking one day. I thought of something the world hadn’t seen lately. My thought was of an adventurous man.

This was in March 1878.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s04_p01">Like making all your sentences the same length, starting all your sentences in the same format—say, with “the” or “there”—could result in seriously boring text. Even if you vary your openings slightly but still follow the basic subject–verb–object format every time, you’re missing an opportunity to make your sentences more interesting. Study how the following <strong class="emphasis bold">techniques</strong> for varying the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sentence openers</a><span class="glossdef">The first word of a sentence or the grammatical format with which a sentence begins.</span></span> add interest.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s04_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Example 1</h3>

            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s04_p07"><strong class="emphasis bold">Revision:</strong> The young woman got up off the ground. [<strong class="emphasis bold">Rearrange to create an introductory phrase.</strong>] In a state of shock, she ran to her dorm room.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s04_p08">By placing a key word or phrase at the end of a sentence, you can also hold readers’ attention as they wait for the full meaning to unfold. This approach of building to a climax places added emphasis on an idea.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s05_p01">Just as you need to use a variety of sentence openers to keep text interesting, you should vary your sentence structure.
