        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s01_p01">Commas set introductory words, phrases, and clauses apart from the rest of a sentence. This separation serves to signal a reader to pause and to give words a chance to have meaning without interference from other words.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Commas in a Series</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s02_p01">A series is a list embedded in a sentence with a conjunction, typically the word “and,” between the last two items in the list. Without the commas, a series can be quite confusing.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s02_p03">With a little work, a reader can possibly identify the five items that made up Penny’s costume. But the sentence is confusing and requires too much work to read. Inserting commas makes reading this sentence very easy and clear.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s02_p05">Some usage experts promote the idea that the comma immediately before the conjunction is optional since it has fallen out of universal use. However, it is still wise to use it to avoid inadvertent confusion.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Commas in Compound Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s03_p01">When a sentence is made up of two independent clauses joined by a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coordinating conjunction</a><span class="glossdef">A word used to link two independent clauses in a compound sentence (e.g., and, but, for, so, nor, or, yet); when used in this way, it is preceded by only a comma.</span></span> (<em class="emphasis">and</em>, <em class="emphasis">but</em>, <em class="emphasis">for</em>, <em class="emphasis">nor/or</em>, <em class="emphasis">so</em>, <em class="emphasis">yet</em>), a comma is needed between the two clauses. Remember that an independent clause must have both a subject and a verb and be able to serve as a stand-alone sentence.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s04_p01">To create interest and increase clarification, you may want to add words and phrases to basic sentences. These additional pieces often function as add-ons that are not essential to the core meaning of the sentence and do not change the meaning of the sentence. You should separate such words and phrases from the rest of the sentence. Some examples of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonessential words</a><span class="glossdef">A word that is in a sentence but could be removed without changing the core meaning of the sentence.</span></span> include adjective phrases and clauses, words of direct address, interjections, and appositives.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p01">Some adjective phrases and clauses are essential to the meaning of a sentence and some are not. If they are essential, no comma is needed. If the meaning of the sentence would be intact if the phrase or clause were removed, a comma is needed. You can identify adjective clauses since they often begin with the relative pronouns <em class="emphasis bolditalic">where</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">when</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">which</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">who</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">whom</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">whose</em>, or <em class="emphasis bolditalic">that</em>.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p03">A comma is needed because, even without the adjective phrase, the reader would know that the play lasted for two hours.</p>
