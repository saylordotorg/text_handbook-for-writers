        <li>When you have a group of sentences within a paragraph, read the sentences backward so that no sentence can gain information from the preceding sentence. This technique will help sentence fragments stand out since they will not make sense alone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p28">Ultimately all these pointers are designed to get you into the habit of asking whether your sentences stand on their own. If you have problems with writing fragments, perform these tests until recognizing what constitutes a sentence becomes second nature to you. When you recognize a fragment, you can turn it into sentence by adding the missing component. Try these examples:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_l03">
        <li>
            <p class="para">This fragment has no subject: Giggling and laughing all the way to school.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p29"><em class="emphasis">One possible way to add a subject and turn this fragment into a sentence:</em></p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p30"><em class="emphasis bolditalic">The girls were</em> <em class="emphasis">giggling and laughing all the way to school.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">This fragment has no predicate: A brand new iPhone with all kinds of apps.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p31"><em class="emphasis">One possible way to add a predicate and turn this fragment into a sentence:</em></p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p32"><em class="emphasis">A brand new iPhone with all kinds of apps</em> <em class="emphasis bolditalic">isn’t cheap!</em></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p33">Just as sentences require a subject and a predicate, they also have boundaries.
