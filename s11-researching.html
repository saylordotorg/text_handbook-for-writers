        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p02">If the assignment does not give you a clear idea of genre through the imperative verbs it uses, ask your instructor for some guidance. This being college, it’s possible that genre, like some other matters, is being left up to you. In such a scenario, the genre(s) you adopt will depend on what you decide about your purposes for writing. The truth is, genres blend into each other in real writing for real audiences. For example, how can you “take a position” about a social issue like teen pregnancy without doing some reporting and offering some solutions? How can you offer solutions to problems like climate change without first reporting on the severity of the problem, arguing for the urgency of the need for solutions, arguing that your solution is the best of several proposals, and finally arguing for your solution’s feasibility and cost effectiveness?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p03">Take the case of Jacoba, who is given the following <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inquiry-based research</a><span class="glossdef">A type of assignment requiring exploration of a topic about which the student does not have a prior opinion.</span></span> assignment, a genre of academic writing that is becoming increasingly common at the college level:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p04">In an essay of at least twenty-five hundred words, I want you to explore a topic that means something to you but about which you do not yet have a clear opinion. Unlike other “research papers” you may have been asked to write in the past, you should <strong class="emphasis bold">not</strong> have a clear sense of your position or stance about your topic at the outset. Your research should be designed to develop your thinking about your topic, not to confirm an already held opinion, nor to find “straw men” who disagree with you and whose ideas you can knock down with ease.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p05">Make no mistake, by the end of this process, if you have chosen a topic about which you’re really curious and if you research with an open mind, you will have plenty to say. The final product may be submitted in any number of forms (possibilities include an interpretive report, a problem-solving proposal, a manifesto-like position statement) but it must be grounded in source work and it must demonstrate your ability to incorporate other voices into your work and to document them appropriately (using MLA standards). And like any other writing we have done in this course so far, you are responsible for determining the audiences you want to reach and the purposes you want to achieve.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p06">In this assignment, Jacoba and her classmates are intentionally given very little direct guidance and very few explicit instructions from their instructor about how to proceed. After some class discussion and some initial brainstorming on her own, she decides he wants to research and write about the crisis in solvency in Social Security. Prior to researching, she isn’t exactly sure how she feels about the issue, much less about an appropriate audience or purpose. She just knows she’s worried about her own aging parents and feels they deserve what’s coming to them. At the same time, she’s rankled that, in her early twenties, she has no expectation of ever seeing any of the money that’s been coming out of her paycheck every two weeks. The combination of uncertainty and interest she feels about the topic actually makes it ideal for this kind of inquiry-based research project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p07">Using the tips in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>, Jacoba puts together two preliminary statements of purpose intentionally at odds with each other.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Deciding How and Where You Will Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s03_p01">Although you might think that you can accomplish all of your research online from the comfort of your home, you should at least begin by visiting your school library. Talk to a research librarian about your planned paper and get his or her advice. You will likely learn about some in-library sources that would be helpful. But you will also probably discover some online sources and procedures that will be very beneficial. Another technique you can use for learning about research options is to talk to fellow students who have recently completed research projects. As always, you might be surprised what you can learn by such networking. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Primary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Firsthand source (e.g., in-person interviews and observations).</span></span>, such as in-person interviews and observations, can add an interesting dimension to a researched essay.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selecting a Writing Venue</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s04_p01">Your writing venue might be predetermined for you. For example, you might be required to turn in a Microsoft Word file or you might be required to work on an online class site. Before you start, make sure you know how you will be presenting your final essay and if and how you are to present drafts along the way. Having to reroute your work along the way unnecessarily wastes time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Setting Up a Method of Documenting Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s05_p01">You will need to document your sources as you research since you clearly do not want to have to revisit any of your sources to retrieve documentation information. Although you can use the traditional method of creating numbered source cards to which you tie all notes you take, it makes much more sense to create digital note cards. Most college library databases include options for keeping a record of your sources. Using these tools can save you time and make the research process easier. Such sites also allow you to take notes and tie each note to one of the citations. Make sure to explore the services that are available to you. If you haven’t seen a college library database in some time, you will be pleasantly surprised at all the time-saving features they provide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s05_p02">You can also create your version of digital note cards simply by making a file with numbered citations and coding your notes to the citations. If you choose, you can go online and find a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">citation builder</a><span class="glossdef">Online tool into which you can plug source information and receive a properly written citation in a chosen documentation style.</span></span> for assistance. Once you put a source’s information into the builder, you can copy and paste the citation into your citation file and into the citation list at the end of your paper. Your college library’s databases include tools that will help you build citations in American Psychological Association (APA), Modern Language Association (MLA), or other styles. Similar tools are also available with no college or university affiliation, but these tend to have ad content and can sometimes be less reliable. Another, less commercial option is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">online writing lab (OWL)</a><span class="glossdef">A university-sponsored, ad-free, free-to-use site full of writing instructions.</span></span>. OWLs are college-level writing instruction sites managed by university writing programs and usually open to public use. The most famous and, according to many, still the best, is managed by the Purdue Writing Program: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu">http://owl.english.purdue.edu</a>. Bookmark this site on your computer for the rest of your college career. You won’t regret it.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Determining Your Timeline</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p01">Begin with the amount of time you have to complete your project. Create a research and writing schedule that can realistically fit into your life and allow you to generate a quality product. Then stick with your plan. As with many time consuming tasks, if you fall off your schedule, you are likely to find yourself having to work long hours or having to make concessions in order to finish in time. Since such actions will probably result in an end product of lesser quality, making and keeping a schedule is an excellent idea.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p02">As a rule, when you make a schedule, it is best to plan to spend a little time each day as opposed to long blocks of time on a few days. Although, on a long project, you might find it beneficial to have some lengthy days, as a rule, long hours on a single project do not fit into one’s daily life very well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p03">As you schedule your time, plan for at least one spare day before the project is due as sort of an insurance policy. In other words, don’t set your schedule to include working through the last available minute. A spare day or two gives you some flexibility in case the process doesn’t flow along perfectly according to your plan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p04">If you plan to have others proofread your work, respectfully consider their schedules. You can’t make a plan that requires others to drop what they are doing to read your draft on your schedule.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Starting a Research Log to Track Your Ideas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s07_p01">A research log is a great tool for keeping track of ideas that come to you while you are working. For example, you might think of another direction you want to pursue or find another source you want to follow up on. Since it is so easy to forget a fleeting but useful thought, keeping an ongoing log can be very helpful. The style or format of such a log will vary according to your personality. If you’re the type of person who likes to have a strict timeline, the log could be a chronologically arranged to-do list or even a series of alarms and reminders programmed into your cell phone. If, on the other hand, you’re a bit more conceptual or abstract in your thinking, keeping an up-to-date statement of purpose chart might be the way to go.</p>

Also, as you begin a research project, you have to decide whether you will use a simple word processing document or a more complex format, such as an online class site set up by your instructor. At the very beginning of a project, you should also make a plan for documenting your sources so that you are organized from the start.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s02_p01">Your status as a student grants you access to your college library, and it is in your best interest to use it. Whether you are using your library online or in person, you will most likely need some guidance so that you know the research options available and how to access them. If you are attending a traditional brick-and-mortar college, the quickest way to learn about your library options is to physically go to the library and meet with a librarian. If you are attending school mostly or completely online, look for online tutorials offered by your college library. College libraries still have print holdings that are worth checking out, but the landscape is quickly going digital. In recent years, libraries have been digitizing their print holdings and spending an increasing percentage of their budgets on acquiring better and richer academic <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">databases</a><span class="glossdef">An extensive collection of related information that is available digitally.</span></span> with vast holdings you can use for most of your research needs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s02_p02">Within the array of online options available to you, the academic databases to which your library subscribes are generally more <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">authoritative</a><span class="glossdef">Describing a source that has been edited and often peer reviewed before being accepted for publication.</span></span> because they have been edited and in many cases peer reviewed before being approved for publication. These sources often appeared in print before being collected in the database. However, databases can take you only so far in your research. If you have questions that need quick answers, especially involving facts or statistics, there’s nothing wrong with using popular search engines like Google or even online encyclopedias like Wikipedia, provided you use them critically. Confirm the truth of the information you find by finding corroboration from at least two other sources, and follow up on the sources listed in the sites to which you are directed. For more on evaluating online sources, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07_s05#mccrimmon-ch07_s05">Section 7.5 "Evaluating Sources"</a>.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s02_p03">Along with the search engines, databases, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">directories</a><span class="glossdef">Online list of websites relating to given topics.</span></span>, the Internet also offers a variety of additional tools and services that are very useful to you as a researcher.

An effective research project will likely combine source material from both academic databases and more popularly available online sites.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s02_p04">In addition to print and online sources, you might also wish to find some <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">field sources</a><span class="glossdef">Primary source accessed in its natural setting.</span></span>, such as interviewing an expert, sorting through relevant documents, making observations, or attending an event that relates to your topic.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s03_p08">When you find a helpful article or Internet site, look for additional search terms and sources that you can follow up on. If you don’t have time to follow up on them all when you find them, include them in your research log for later follow-up. When possible, copy and paste terms and links into your log. When you have to retype, take great care with spelling, spacing, and most of all, attributing direct quotations to their original source.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s03_p09">The aforementioned tips are general ideas for keyword searching. When you are searching within a database or a certain <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">search engine</a><span class="glossdef">A computer program that searches on the World Wide Web.</span></span>, pay attention to any search tips or help screens that present methods that work well with the specific database or search engine.

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s03_l02">
            <li>A quick and easy way to increase your search results is to try synonyms of your initial search term, such as “ethanol” for “ethyl alcohol.” A similar step is to try components of an idea, such as “wood,” “ethanol,” and “algae” when you are searching for biofuel.</li>
            <li>You can use special techniques to more accurately target your search. Using multiple words will typically narrow your search more specifically to the information you want. For example, “ethyl alcohol” will bring up a wide range of uses of ethyl alcohol, such as fuel, drinking alcohol, chemistry, and lotions. A search for “ethyl alcohol as fuel” will limit the results to only the use of ethyl alcohol as fuel. Similarly, the use of quotation marks will limit search results to a complete term rather than to individual parts of a term. For example, within quotations, “algae energy” returns only results that include both words. Following a word with an asterisk or a question mark invites results including alternate endings of the word. And using parentheses allows you to combine multiple searches.</li>
            <li>Using “AND” allows you to make sure a search includes identified words. Inserting “OR” between two words lets you conduct two individual searches at once. Placing “NOT” between two words excludes all results including the second word.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p01">When you are researching for an essay, your attitude and stamina are key to your success. If you let either of these issues get out of hand, you can seriously weaken your project. Before you begin what is essentially a month-long relationship with a topic, you should choose something that interests you, something about which you have an opinion. Even when it is on a topic you care deeply about, researching is often tedious and demands stamina. Assume from the beginning that the project will be time consuming and sometimes exhausting, so make sure to allot the needed time and energy to complete it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p02">If you feel strongly about a topic, you might find it a challenge to keep your attitude in check and to read your sources with an open mind. It is critical not to let your personal opinions drive the information you choose to include. Try to create a well-rounded paper. If all the sources you find appear to agree with your viewpoints, actively search out a different viewpoint to strengthen your paper. Or consider changing your path entirely because if there really isn’t a range of sources out there, you’re probably not working with an arguable topic. (See <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch06#mccrimmon-ch06">Chapter 6 "Drafting"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch06_s02#mccrimmon-ch06_s02">Section 6.2 "Testing a Thesis"</a> for more on how to test a thesis or topic for whether it is arguable.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p03">Along with keeping an open mind (attitude) and keeping to a schedule (stamina), you should, of course, read critically, using some of the guidelines discussed in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02#mccrimmon-ch02">Chapter 2 "Becoming a Critical Reader"</a>. In other words, you should evaluate the arguments and assumptions authors make and, when appropriate, present your evaluations within your paper. You can include biased information if you choose, but be certain to note the bias. This move might be appropriate in a persuasive essay if you are taking issue with a source with which you disagree. But be careful not to settle for too easy a target in such an essay. Don’t pick on a fringe voice in the opposing camp when there’s a more reasonable argument that needs to be dealt with fairly. If a source is simply too biased to be useful even as an opposing argument, then you may choose not to include it as part of your essay. Your basic principle of selection for a source, regardless of whether you agree with it as a matter of opinion, should be based on whether you think the information includes sound assumptions, meaningful evidence, and logical conclusions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p04">You also need to pose productive questions throughout the process, using some of the guidelines in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>. If you are writing on a topic about which you already have a very clear stance, consider whether there is common ground you share with your ideological opponents that might lead to a more productive use of your time and theirs. In general, persuasive essays are more effective if they also solve problems instead of just staking out an inflexible position based on a core set of inflexible assumptions. It’s not that you shouldn’t write about abortion or capital punishment if these issues mean something to you. It’s just that you don’t want to go down the same path that’s been followed by millions of students who have come before you. So how do you ask fresh questions about classic topics? Often by rewinding to the causes of the effects people typically argue about or simply by pledging to report the facts of the matter in depth.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p04">A source is <strong class="emphasis bold">relevant</strong> if it can contribute to your paper in a meaningful way, which might include any of the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_l02">
        <li>Supplies support for core argument(s)</li>
        <li>Adds a sense of authority to your argument(s)</li>

        <li>Provides other viewpoints</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p05">When determining if a source is <strong class="emphasis bold">current</strong> enough to use, a general rule of thumb is that a source must be no more than ten years old. In some situations, very few sources exist that were published within the last ten years, so older sources can be used as long as you explain why the use of the older sources is acceptable and meaningful. Or perhaps you may be using older sources to establish a historical record of thoughts and statements on your issue in question.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p06">Before you use a source, you need to satisfy yourself that the information is <strong class="emphasis bold">accurate</strong>. In print sources, you can use the author (if known) and the publisher to help you decide. If you think the author and publisher are legitimate sources, then you are probably safe in assuming that their work is accurate. In the case of online information, in addition to considering the author and publisher, you can look at how long ago the site was updated, if evidence is provided to back up statements, and if the information appears to be thorough. For either print or online sources, you can check accuracy by finding other sources that support the facts in question.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p07">You can deem a source to be <strong class="emphasis bold">reasonable</strong> if it makes overall sense as you read through it. In other words, use your personal judgment to determine if you think the information the source provides sounds plausible.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Reliable</strong> sources do not show <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bias</a><span class="glossdef">Prejudice or a nonobjective stance.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conflict of interest</a><span class="glossdef">A situation where a person or organization might personally benefit from his, her, or its public actions or influence.</span></span>. For example, don’t choose a toy company’s site for information about toys that are best for children. If you are unsure about the reliability of a source, check to see if it includes a list of references, and then track down a sampling of those references. Also, check the publisher. Reliable publishers rarely involve themselves with unreliable information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p09">A source is <strong class="emphasis bold">objective</strong> if it provides both sides of an argument or more than one viewpoint. Although you can use sources that do not provide more than one viewpoint, you need to balance them with sources that provide other viewpoints.</p>

In fact, next to building a solid research plan, the note taking process is perhaps the most critical part of your prewriting process.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Three Types of Note Taking</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s01_p01">When you are completing a research paper, you will use three types of note taking: summarizing, paraphrasing, and quoting. Since, at the note taking stage, you do not know for sure how you will use the information you find, you will not know for sure which kind of notes to take for which sources. Use the following general guidelines to decide:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s01_l01">
            <li>Summarize lengthy information that will add to your paper without including the smaller details.</li>
            <li>Paraphrase information and details that will serve as significant support for your core points but that isn’t so eloquently stated that you want to use the exact words. Also, paraphrase texts with vital details that are simply too lengthy to quote.</li>
            <li>Use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quotations</a><span class="glossdef">Exact words spoken by another person or presented in a body of text.</span></span> to emphasize important information that will be very impressive or poignant and that will serve its purpose best if the original words are used. Keep in mind that no more than about 10 percent of your paper should be quoted text. Your paper should be in your words with a few quotations as opposed to a collection of quotations connected with your words. (For examples of each kind of use of source material, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07_s07#mccrimmon-ch07_s07">Section 7.7 "Making Ethical and Effective Choices"</a>.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s01_p02">You will use most of the information you find in either a summarized or paraphrased format. So use those formats as you write. Make your best guess about how you will want to use the information. Do not ever copy and paste from a source directly into your working files unless you intend to use the information as an exact quotation. If you do intend to use an exact quotation, use the quotations when you take the initial note.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Organizing Your Notes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s02_p01">Traditionally, notes were taken by hand on note cards and then filed by topic until you were ready to sort them out and put them in the order you would use them. Once the note cards were in order, you could begin typing your paper and inserting the information from the cards into the correct spots. You could still use that method if you want to. But to do so would add, depending on the size of your paper, hours, days, or weeks to the process. Since you most likely are not interested in increasing the amount of time needed to write your paper, you should keep your notes in a computer file (backed up elsewhere). Doing so will allow you to use copy and paste features to assemble and rearrange your notes. The digital format also allows you to easily add information as desired.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s02_p02">To organize your notes as you take them, assign each subtopic to a separate section within a file or to a separate file. Sorting your notes so that like topics are grouped together will help streamline the writing process.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Backing Up Your Work</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s03_p01">Crashing computers can cause serious loss of data, so make sure you back up your work. You can use a variety of methods of backing up your work, including the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s03_l01">
            <li>Use a conventional hard drive backup system.</li>
            <li>Copy your work onto a flash drive.</li>
            <li>Post your work to an online site, such as a wiki, so that you can access it from any computer.</li>
            <li>Send your work to an online e-mail address (yours or someone else’s) so you can access it from any computer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s03_p02">If you do not have a method of backing up your data, periodically print your work so that you won’t lose as much if you have a crash. You could then probably scan the pages using a text format and have the data back in your computer quite quickly. Even if you have to rekey the information to get it back into the computer, that process will be much faster than starting completely over.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Including Your Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s04_p01">As you take notes, make sure to include the source for each piece of information. Keep the complete citation in a master reference list that is either at the end of your paper or in a separate reference file. In addition, within your notes, insert the information you need for an in-text reference. (See <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22#mccrimmon-ch22" xrefstyle="select: title">Chapter 22 "Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation"</a> for correct formatting of in-text references within the different citation styles.) Including the necessary in-text information within your notes is another way of cutting down the time needed to write your paper.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s04_p02">For all notes you take, record the page(s) where you found the information. Doing so will assure you have the information at hand if you need it for your reference. In addition, having the page numbers readily available will allow you to easily revisit sources. So that you do not inadvertently leave a page number where you do not want it, add bolding and color to your page numbers to make them stand out.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s05_p01">As noted earlier, you should copy and paste only information that you intend to quote. By limiting your copying and pasting to quoted materials, you are not prone to forgetting that some text is copied and end up <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">plagiarizing</a><span class="glossdef">Using another’s ideas without citing the source.</span></span> without intending to do so. If you find it helpful, you can add a colored notation identifying each piece of information as a quotation, summary, or paraphrase. As with the page numbers, by using colored text, you can avoid copying and pasting your tags into your paper as you write. For an example of this kind of color-coding approach, see the annotated bibliography in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07_s08#mccrimmon-ch07_s08">Section 7.8 "Creating an Annotated Bibliography"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s05_p02">Another method of inadvertent plagiarism is to paraphrase too closely. You can avoid this pitfall by reading a paragraph and then, without looking back, writing about the paragraph. Unless you have a photographic memory, this method will result in you rewording the idea. When you finish writing, look back to make sure you included all aspects of the original text and to clarify that you depicted the ideas accurately.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s05_p03">When you are planning to quote an author’s exact words, follow these guidelines:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s06_s05_l01">
            <li>If possible, copy and paste the quotation so you know you have not made any inadvertent changes.</li>
            <li>Be very careful not to change any word orders, word choices, spellings, or punctuations.</li>
            <li>Use quotations.</li>
            <li>If you choose to omit any words from the quotation, indicate this omission by replacing the words with ellipses (…).</li>
            <li>If you add additional words to the quotation, place them within square brackets ([]).</li>

                <li>When you take notes, you will either summarize, paraphrase, or quote all the information. You will summarize when the small details are not important, paraphrase when the details are important but the words are not eloquent, and quote when the information is both important and eloquent.</li>
                <li>Organize your notes by topic either within one file or in one file for each topic. Back up your work by using a backup hard drive or a flash drive, posting it to a wiki, sending it to an online e-mail address, or printing it out.</li>
                <li>Create a master list of your references. Also, include in-text reference information and page numbers with each note you take. To make sure you do not plagiarize, only copy and paste when you are quoting. Paraphrase or summarize all other information. When you are paraphrasing, read the information, look away, and type it in your own words. Then check back to make sure your version is accurate. When you are quoting, take care to use the text exactly as you find it unless you use brackets to indicate additions or ellipses to indicate omissions.</li>

Such information does not require a citation. One way to identify such information is to note that it is presented in multiple sources without documentation. Another identification method is to realize that you, along with most people you know, are aware of the information. For example, you can write that “Cheyenne is the capital of Wyoming” without needing a reference. On the other hand, if you were to note that there is a high rate of divorce in Cheyenne, you would need to cite that detail.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Properly Summarizing and Paraphrasing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s02_p01">When you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">summarize</a><span class="glossdef">To use a few words or sentences to describe the key ideas of a text.</span></span>, you should write in your own words and the result should be substantially shorter than the original text.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s02_p02">You should also use your words when you <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">paraphrase</a><span class="glossdef">To use your ideas to inclusively present the ideas from a selection.</span></span>. Paraphrasing should also involve your own sentence structure. Paraphrasing might, however, be as long or even longer than the original text. When you paraphrase, you should include, in your words, all the ideas from the original text in the same order as in the original text. You should not insert any of your ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s02_p03">Both summaries and paraphrases should maintain the original author’s intent and slant. Taking details out of context to suit your purposes is not ethical since it does not honor the original author’s ideas.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Correctly Citing Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s03_p01">Citing sources is critical since you do not want to be guilty of stealing ideas from others, and using others’ intellectual property without giving them credit is, indeed, a form of stealing. A bonus that comes with citing sources is that aligning others’ ideas with your ideas adds credibility to your ideas and helps establish your <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethos</a><span class="glossdef">A writer’s credibility and trustworthiness, established by researchers through the responsible and ethical use of sources.</span></span>. Also, when you address more than one viewpoint, you strengthen your viewpoint.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s03_p02">In order to know exactly how you should cite sources, you need to know the reference style you will be using. The most popular formats are American Psychological Association (APA), Modern Language Association (MLA), Chicago, and Council of Science Editors (CSE). You can read more about these different styles and others in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22#mccrimmon-ch22" xrefstyle="select: title">Chapter 22 "Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s03_p03">Regardless of which citation style you use, you should follow the following general guidelines:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s03_l01">
            <li>Enclose all direct quotations in quotation marks and cite the source within the text, including page number, author, and year (if your style requires all these parts) so it is very clear where you acquired the information.</li>
            <li>When you summarize or paraphrase text, do not use quotations, but note the author and year (or other required information depending on the citation style) either as part of the sentence or in parentheses following the sentence to clearly note that the ideas belong to someone else.</li>
            <li>At the end of your paper, include a complete list of references, each properly cited using the required citation style.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making Sure Material Is Available for Use</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s07_s04_p01">As you are searching for sources, be sure to determine that you can ethically use the material. As a rule, you can reference most text as long as you properly cite it. Images are another issue. When you search online for images, you will find many private and for-profit sources. You should not use these images without contacting the source and requesting permission. For example, you might find a picture of a darling little boy from someone’s personal unprotected photo page or a good picture of an orderly closet from a company’s web page. Using such photos just because you can access them is not ethical. And citing the source is not adequate in these situations. You should either obtain written permission or forgo the use of such images.</p>

                <li>Common knowledge is information that most people know and that is available in many sources. Common knowledge does not have to be cited. Proprietary ideas are those that belong to someone else and must be cited.</li>

                <li>Take care to put exact quotations within quotation marks and to reference all borrowed ideas; use the citation style you are required to use.</li>
                <li>You should determine if you can ethically use content from a source, especially in the case of images. You can usually reference text ethically by citing it correctly, but it is wise to have signed consent when using visual content.</li>

Under each subtopic, list your supporting points you have researched as well as the ideas you plan to add. When you are finished, evaluate your outline by asking questions such as the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s09_l02">
        <li>Do I want to tweak my planned thesis based on the information I have found?</li>
        <li>Do all of my planned subtopics still seem reasonable?</li>
        <li>Did I find an unexpected subtopic that I want to add?</li>
        <li>In what order do I want to present my subtopics?</li>
        <li>Are my supporting points in the best possible order?</li>
        <li>Do I have enough support for each of my main subtopics? Will the support I have convince readers of my points?</li>
        <li>Do I have ample materials for the required length of the paper? If not, what angle do I want to enhance?</li>
        <li>Have I gathered too much information for a paper of this length? And if so, what should I get rid of?</li>
        <li>Did I include information in my notes that really doesn’t belong and needs to be eliminated? (If so, cut it out and place it in a discard file rather than deleting it. That way, it is still available if you change your mind once you start drafting.)</li>
        <li>Are my planned quotations still good choices?</li>
    </ul>
