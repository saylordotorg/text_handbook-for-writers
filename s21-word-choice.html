        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing without Jargon or Slang</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s02_p01">Jargon and slang both have their places. Using jargon is fine as long as you can safely assume your readers also know the jargon. For example, if you are a lawyer, and you are writing to others in the legal profession, using legal jargon is perfectly fine. On the other hand, if you are writing for people outside the legal profession, using legal jargon would most likely be confusing, and you should avoid it. Of course, lawyers must use legal jargon in papers they prepare for customers. However, those papers are designed to navigate within the legal system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s02_p02">You are, of course, free to use slang within your personal life, but unless you happen to be writing a sociolinguistic study of slang itself, it really has no place in academic writing. Even if you are writing somewhat casual responses in an online discussion for a class, you should avoid using slang or other forms of abbreviated communication common to IM (instant messaging) and texting.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting an Appropriate Level of Formality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s04_p01">Look at the following three sentences. They all three carry roughly the same meaning. Which one is the best way to write the sentence?</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>The doctor said, “A full eight hours of work is going to be too much for this patient to handle for at least the next two weeks.”</li>
            <li>The doctor said I couldn’t work full days for the next two weeks.</li>
            <li>my md said 8 hrs of wrk R 2M2H for the next 2 wks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s04_p02">If you said, “It depends,” you are right! Each version is appropriate in certain situations. Every writing situation requires you to make a judgment regarding the level of formality you want to use. Base your decision on a combination of the subject matter, the audience, and your purpose for writing. For example, if you are sending a text message to a friend about going bowling, the formality shown in example three is fine. If, on the other hand, you are sending a text message to that same friend about the death of a mutual friend, you would logically move up the formality of your tone at least to the level of example two.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_p01">By using precise wording, you can most accurately relay your thoughts. Some strategies that can help you put your thoughts into words include focusing on denotations and connotations, balancing specific and concrete words with occasionally figurative language, and being on guard against clichés and misused words.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Focusing on Both Denotations and Connotations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01_p01">Consider that the words “laid-back” and “lackadaisical” both mean “unhurried and slow-moving.” If someone said you were a “laid-back” student, you would likely be just fine with that comment, but if someone said you were a “lackadaisical” student, you might not like the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">connotation</a><span class="glossdef">The emotional sense of a word; the various ways in which it can be received by a listener or reader.</span></span>. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs all have both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">denotations</a><span class="glossdef">The definition of a word.</span></span> and connotations. The denotation is the definition of a word. The connotation is the emotional sense of a word. For example, look at these three words:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>excited</li>
            <li>agitated</li>
            <li>flustered</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01_p02">The three words all mean to be stirred emotionally. In fact, you might see one of the words as a definition of another one of them. And you would definitely see the three words in a common list in a thesaurus. So the denotations for the three words are about the same. But the connotations are quite different. The word “excited” often has a positive, fun underlying meaning; “agitated” carries a sense of being upset; and “flustered” suggests a person is somewhat out of control. When you are choosing a word to use, you should first think of a word based on its denotation. Then you should consider if the connotation fits your intent. For more on using a dictionary or thesaurus to enhance and add precision to your word choices, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch17_s04#mccrimmon-ch17_s04">Section 17.4 "Using the Dictionary and Thesaurus Effectively"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing Specific and Concrete Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s02_p01">You will always give clearer information if you write with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific words</a><span class="glossdef">A detail within a category (e.g., cat within the category animals).</span></span> rather than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">general words</a><span class="glossdef">A category (e.g., animals).</span></span>.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s02_p04">Another way to make your writing clearer and more interesting is to use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete words</a><span class="glossdef">A word that evokes a physical sense such as taste, smell, hearing, sight, or touch.</span></span> rather than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">abstract words</a><span class="glossdef">A word that does not have physical properties.</span></span>. Abstract words do not have physical properties. But concrete words evoke senses of taste, smell, hearing, sight, and touch. For example, you could say, “My shoe feels odd.” This statement does not give a sense of why your shoe feels odd since odd is an abstract word that doesn’t suggest any physical characteristics. Or you could say, “My shoe feels wet.” This statement gives you a sense of how your shoe feels to the touch. It also gives a sense of how your shoe might look as well as how it might smell.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s04_p01">Dictionaries and thesauruses provide writing assistance for writers of all levels of experience and ability. Think of them as tools that will help you to do your very best writing. A dictionary can help you determine the precise denotations of words, while a thesaurus, used responsibly, can help you to capture subtle differences in the connotations of words.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Dictionaries</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s04_s01_p01">Technology is changing the face of dictionaries. A short twenty or thirty years ago, a good graduation gift for a college-bound student was a hardcover dictionary. Today very few college students even own one because online dictionaries are so readily available. Using an online dictionary, you can look up a word in the time it takes to type it, as opposed to taking the time to flip pages and scan through a page of words in a print dictionary. On the other hand, a hard-copy dictionary is still a great backup if you’re unable to get online, and it can lead to some surprising discoveries of other words on the same page, just as browsing through a shelf of library books can put you in contact with books you might not have otherwise encountered.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s04_s01_p02">The important issue is that you use a dictionary of some kind and that you understand what it can provide for you. Whether you use a print or online dictionary, the entries offer a wealth of information. <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch17_s04_s01_f01">Figure 17.2</a> includes some of the most common dictionary entry components. Following the list is a color-coded entry for “elementary” (from Dictionary.com, based on the <em class="emphasis">Random House Unabridged Dictionary</em>) showing where various parts of the entry can be found:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s04_s02_p01">Like dictionaries, thesauruses are available in both print and online media. And as with dictionaries, the convenience of modern technology dictates that online thesauruses are the preferred choice of most college students these days. One warning about thesauruses: they can be overused or used out of context. You might be tempted to use a “fancier” <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">synonym</a><span class="glossdef">A word with a meaning similar to another word.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">antonym</a><span class="glossdef">A word with the opposite meaning of another word.</span></span> for a word when a simple and direct approach might be best.</p>
