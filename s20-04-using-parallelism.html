It’s one of those features of writing that’s a matter of grammar, style, rhetoric, and content. Used well, it can enhance your readers’ (and even your own) understanding and appreciation of a topic. The most famous line from John F. Kennedy’s Inaugural Address provides another example (a specific kind of reversal of phrasing known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">antimetabole</a><span class="glossdef">A specific kind of parallelism involving the repetition and reversal of elements of a phrase.</span></span>): “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” You’ll encounter parallelism not only in politics but in advertising, religion, and poetry as well:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_l02">
        <li>“Strong enough for a man, but made for a woman.”</li>
        <li>“Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.”</li>
        <li>“Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p02">Here are a couple of examples of sentences in need of parallelism.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Example 1</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">While it was raining, I had to run into the grocery store, the dry cleaners, and stop at the bookstore.</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p04">This sentence is not parallel because it includes three equally weighted ideas but presents two of them with action verbs and one without. By simply adding words such as “duck into” to the middle item, the sentence becomes parallel: <em class="emphasis bolditalic">While it was raining, I had to run into the grocery store, duck into the dry cleaners, and stop at the bookstore.</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p05">You could also correct this sentence by removing “stop at” from the third idea: <em class="emphasis bolditalic">While it was raining, I had to run into the grocery store, the dry cleaners, and the book store.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_n03">
        <h3 class="title">Example 2</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">The test was long and requiring skills we hadn’t learned.</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p07">This sentence is not parallel because it presents two like-weighted ideas using two different grammatical formats. Here is a parallel version:</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p08"><em class="emphasis bolditalic">The test was long and required skills we hadn’t learned.</em></p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p09">Parallelism is most often an issue with paired ideas and items in a series as shown in the preceding two examples. A key idea to keep in mind is that you need to use common wording with both items, such as common articles (e.g., <em class="emphasis">the</em>, <em class="emphasis">a</em>, <em class="emphasis">an</em>) and common prepositions (e.g., <em class="emphasis">by</em>, <em class="emphasis">for</em>, <em class="emphasis">of</em>, <em class="emphasis">on</em>, <em class="emphasis">to</em>). The next two subsections provide more in-depth discussion of these two concepts.</p>
