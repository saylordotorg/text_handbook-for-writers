        <h2 class="title editable block">More Involved Than Following a Map or Outline</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s00_p01">Once you have created a map or outline or gathered your ideas in another way, you might think that the hardest part of the writing project is over, so now you can just follow your plan. However, the drafting process is actually much more complicated than that. You need to pay attention and think while you are writing and reading about your topic, so you notice meaningful changes you can make in your plan. You should continue to generate questions throughout the drafting and revising process. Even though you have a chosen topic, you need to formulate, support, and test your thesis (or main idea) and be prepared to modify it significantly in the face of new evidence or a change in your attitude toward the topic. You will also need to strive for an interesting, varied, appropriate, and mechanically sound approach to the paragraphs and sentences that will make up your essay.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s01_p01">Most academic writing includes a thesis, which is the main stance you decide to take toward your topic. Your thesis tells readers what your paper will be about. It also serves as a target you must ultimately hit as you write, though that target may move around quite a bit as you go through the drafting process. You might have an idea about your thesis early on, or you might only decide upon it once you have worked with your topic and plan for a while. You might continually tweak your thesis as you learn more and develop your opinions about your topic. This table shows how topics and personal stances relate:</p>
    <div class="informaltable block" frame="all">

                    <td>College students’ schedules</td>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s01_p02">Developing your personal stance is critical for several reasons. It narrows your topic to a final manageable level, and it makes the written work uniquely yours. Taking a personal stance gives you a point of view to develop, support, and defend. When you present your stance, it ultimately awakens emotions in your readers as they determine for themselves whether they agree or disagree with your stance.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s01_p03">If you have trouble deciding on a thesis, keep in mind that your thesis ties directly to the main purpose and audience of your writing project. It is the main point you want to make to your audience. Ask yourself how you personally relate to the topic. Take the college students’ schedules topic, for example. Your response to how you are personally related to the topic could be one of the following:</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s01_l02">
        <li>I am a person with knowledge to share since my mother always set my college schedules for me resulting in me having little understanding about designing a schedule that works.</li>
        <li>I am an angry student since my father insisted on setting up my schedule, and my classes are all spread out in a way that will make my year miserable.</li>
        <li>I am an interested observer since my roommate’s mother always set her schedules and almost always ruined our plans to have some common free blocks of time.</li>
        <li>I have an opinion that I would like to share about “helicopter parents,” and this is a particularly good example of the phenomenon.</li>
        <li>This semester, after talking with an advisor, I sketched out the rest of the coursework in my major, and I see for the first time how everything’s going to fit together.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s01_p04">Once you see how you personally relate to your topic, you can then more clearly see what stance you want to take. Once you take a stance, work on wording it effectively, and you will have a working thesis.</p>

Read the tips if you need some help answering the questions.</p>
    <div class="exercises editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Questions</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #1:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">interesting</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p03">Tip: When you read the thesis statement, do you find yourself wondering about different aspects of the topic? In other words, do you want to know the answer to the thesis question? Do you think others will also want to know?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #2:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">arguable</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p05">Tip: If you are writing an argumentative essay and developing a thesis for a topic that is controversial, make sure you can also formulate in your head what the thesis for “the other side” would sound like.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #3:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">specific</strong> enough?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p07">Tip: Make certain that your thesis addresses a specific point about a specific person, place, idea, or situation. Do not proceed with vague wording, such as “all over the world,” “many people,” or “will cause problems.” Avoid relying too much on qualitative, superlative, or hyperbolic language, such as excellent, awesome, interesting, sad, or silly. Such words do not carry any concrete meaning.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #4:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">manageable</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p09">Tip: If you would have to research for two solid months to cover the breadth of the thesis, it is not suitable for a five-page paper. On the other hand, if a reader can understand the whole point simply by reading the thesis, the thesis is not suitable.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p10"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #5:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">researchable</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p11">Tip: Make sure you are confident that you will be able to find the information you need. Proceeding when you think you will have trouble finding enough information can cost you a lot of time if you come to a point where you think you have to start over.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p12"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #6:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">significant</strong> to you and others?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p13">Tip: If you choose a thesis that you care deeply about, others are likely to also find it significant. After you determine that your thesis is something about which you care deeply, you should double-check that your desired audience will also care.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p14">After you have chosen a topic and a thesis and have begun work on the essay, you will be invested in your idea, so it won’t be as easy to answer these questions objectively. But doing so early on is worth the effort since the process will likely result in a more successful essay in the long run.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Supporting Details</h2>

            <img src="section_10/e6c21b754112dc12a66506ff01fbc617.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s01_p01">You can and should use a variety of kinds of support for your thesis. One of the easiest forms of support to use is personal observations and experiences. The strong point in favor of using personal anecdotes is that they add interest and emotion, both of which can pull audiences along. On the other hand, the anecdotal and subjective nature of personal observations and experiences makes them too weak to support a thesis on their own.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s01_p02">Since they can be verified, facts can help strengthen personal anecdotes by giving them substance and grounding. For example, if you tell a personal anecdote about having lost twenty pounds by using a Hula-Hoop for twenty minutes after every meal, the story seems interesting, but readers might not think it is a serious weight-loss technique. But if you follow up the story with some facts about the benefit of exercising for twenty minutes after every meal, the Hula-Hoop story takes on more credibility. Although facts are undeniably useful in writing projects, a paper full of nothing but fact upon fact would not be very interesting to read.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s01_p03">Like anecdotal information, your opinions can help make facts more interesting. On their own, opinions are weak support for a thesis. But coupled with specific relevant facts, opinions can add a great deal of interest to your work. In addition, opinions are excellent tools for convincing an audience that your thesis makes sense.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s01_p04">Similar to your opinions are details from expert testimony and personal interviews. Both of these kinds of sources provide no shortage of opinions. Expert opinions can carry a little more clout than your own, but you should be careful not to rely too much on them. However, it’s safe to say that finding quality opinions from others and presenting them in support of your ideas will make others more likely to agree with your ideas.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s01_p05">Statistics can provide excellent support for your thesis. Statistics are facts expressed in numbers. For example, say you relay the results of a study that showed that 90 percent of people who exercise for twenty minutes after every meal lose two pounds per week. Such statistics lend strong, credible support to a thesis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s01_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Examples</a><span class="glossdef">Choices of details used to clarify a point for readers.</span></span>—real or made up—are powerful tools you can use to clarify and support your facts, opinions, and statistics. A detail that sounds insignificant or meaningless can become quite significant when clarified with an example. For example, you could cite your sister Lydia as an example of someone who lost thirty pounds in a month by exercising after every meal. Using a name and specifics makes it seem very personal and real. As long as you use examples ethically and logically, they can be tremendous assets. On the other hand, when using examples, take care not to intentionally mislead your readers or distort reality. For example, if your sister Lydia also gave birth to a baby during that month, leaving that key bit of information out of the example would be misleading.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Procedures for Using Supporting Details</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02_p01">You are likely to find or think of details that relate to your topic and are interesting, but that do not support your thesis. Including such details in your paper is unwise because they are distracting and irrelevant.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02_p02">In today’s rich world of technology, you have many options when it comes to choosing sources of information. Make sure you choose only reliable sources. Even if some information sounds absolutely amazing, if it comes from an unreliable source, don’t use it. It might sound amazing for a reason—because it has been amazingly made up.</p>
        <div class="figure large editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02_f01">
            <p class="title"><span class="title-prefix">Figure 6.2</span> </p>
            <img src="section_10/355799c2ee3727ffe6722bee6e4d229c.jpg">
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02_p03">When you find a new detail, make sure you can find it in at least one more source so you can safely accept it as true. Take this step even when you think the source is reliable because even reliable sources can include errors. When you find new information, make sure to put it into your essay or file of notes right away. Never rely on your memory.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02_p04">Take great care to organize your supporting details so that they can best support your thesis. One strategy is to list the most powerful information first. Another is to present information in a natural sequence, such as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chronological</a><span class="glossdef">A method of narrative arrangement that places events in their order of occurrence.</span></span> order. A third option is to use a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">compare/contrast</a><span class="glossdef">A writing pattern used to explain how two (or more) things are alike and different.</span></span> format. Choose whatever method you think will most clearly support your thesis.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s03_s02_p05">Make sure to use at least two or three supporting details for each main idea. In a longer essay, you can easily include more than three supporting details per idea, but in a shorter essay, you might not have space for any more.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s04_p01">As you start writing, you are likely to discover that your ideas don’t always come together as you expected. The following list gives some examples of types of unexpected situations you might encounter:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s04_l02">
        <li>Some ideas you thought would expand into multiple paragraphs actually are not meaningful enough to receive that much space. You might have to do some additional brainstorming, research, or both to fill the unexpected extra space or adjust the scope of your topic by broadening it.</li>
        <li>Some ideas you thought would take only a paragraph or two turn out to take considerably more space. You might have to cut something out if you have a tight page limit or adjust the scope of your topic by narrowing it.</li>
        <li>As you write, you get additional ideas that change the direction you intended to take with some of your original ideas. Stop and rethink your direction and make adjustments so that your paper works well.</li>
        <li>Once you get started with your research, you might develop a different attitude about some of the facts you encounter. This change could alter your whole plan and thesis. Decide whether you want change your plan and thesis or incorporate the evolution of your thinking into the essay.</li>
        <li>You could discover that you need to do more research to clarify your ideas, support them, or both. This discovery is extremely common, so you might as well just plan on at least one round of additional, targeted, inquiry-based research after you start writing.</li>
        <li>You might find that you do not have the information you need to transition smoothly from one topic to the next. Take the time to flesh out and articulate the transitions between points and ideas that are probably already half-formed in your head.</li>
        <li>You might find that your writing doesn’t sound as professional as you would like it to sound. Slowly work through your paper replacing some of your more casual wordings with more formal wordings. Conversely, you might find that you need to adjust your tone to a less formal register to meet the needs of your chosen audience and purpose.</li>
        <li>As you are writing, you might realize that you have not included enough of your thoughts and opinions to make the work your own. Add some of your thoughts throughout the work.</li>
        <li>You might realize your writing sounds like a lot of different topics lined up and strung together haphazardly. If this happens, consider if you failed to slow your thinking down enough. Perhaps your topic is still too broad.</li>
        <li>You could realize that the topic on which you are currently focused should have been aligned with a previous idea. If this happens, stop and move things around. Continually pay attention to the organization so that, in the end, your paper flows well.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s04_p02">If you pay attention to your thoughts while you write, you are likely to find that your thoughts can lead to more good ideas. In other words, maintain constant critical inquiry about your content, your formatting, and your relationship to your main topic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s04_p03">Some people tend to “write in the moment” without paying close attention to what they wrote a page ago or what they intend to write on the next page. If you are a person who tends to wander in this way, you should periodically stop and step back to consider how your writing direction is going.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s04_p04">As you write, make notes of all the points that come to your mind as they come so you don’t lose any of them before you can fully incorporate them into your writing or decide if you want to incorporate them.</p>

            <li>Your writing projects will almost never come together exactly as you planned since many unexpected situations can occur, and at least some of them will have an impact on your writing direction.</li>
            <li>Some unexpected situations include ideas taking more or less space than you intended, ideas coming together differently than you planned, a change in your idea about what you want to include, missing transitions, writing that is too casual or formal, and ideas you decide should be in a different order.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s05_p01">It would probably not surprise you if your professor told you to read your research sources carefully and critically and with an open mind. It simply sounds like a logical, good idea. But how do you know if and when you are reading carefully and critically? Do you really know how to read with an open mind?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s05_p02">These are important questions to consider even when you can easily find what appears to be objective, unbiased, unfiltered information about your topic. Let’s return to the idea (from <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02#mccrimmon-ch02">Chapter 2 "Becoming a Critical Reader"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>) about reading closely and carefully. Some sources for a writing assignment can be less than thrilling, so your mind might wander a bit or you might speed-read without really focusing. Reading without your full attention or speeding through the text without taking it in not only is a waste of your time but also can lead to critical errors. To use your time wisely, you should try some techniques for getting the most out of your reading. Anything that gets you physically involved, mentally involved, or both will probably help, such as the following ideas:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s05_l02">
        <li>Use sticky notes to mark points to which you want to return.</li>
        <li>Take notes.</li>
        <li>Ask questions while you read and then look for the answers.</li>
        <li>Copy and paste or type the parts that are relevant to your topic into a document saved as “Source Material for Essay.”</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s05_p03">Once you are reading carefully, you are in the proper position to also read critically. To read critically does <em class="emphasis">not</em> mean to judge severely. Rather, it means to determine what the author’s intent or assumptions are, if the author’s points are adequate to support the intent or assumptions, and if the conclusions work. You have to decide what sense the text makes and whether the information in it will help support the points you are trying to make (or perhaps complicate them or even contradict them).</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s05_p04">One key roadblock that can get in the way of reading critically is letting personal ideas and opinions cloud your judgment. To avoid this possible problem, you need to do your best to read your possible sources with an open mind. Don’t slam a door before you really know what’s behind it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s05_p05">Along with reading other sources carefully, critically, and with an open mind, you should also apply these techniques to your work. By reading your work carefully as you are writing, you will see things you want to change. By reading your work critically and with an open mind, you can get a sense for the parts that are working well and those that aren’t.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_p01">Varied sentences help create more interesting prose. Two key methods of varying your sentences are to use different starting techniques and to change the sentences from within. These two choices have some overlap, but for clarity, we’ll discuss them as separate options here.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Avoiding “The…The…The”</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p01">You have all read “The…The…The” and “There…There…There” and “I…I…I” texts. When almost every sentence of a text begins exactly alike, it develops a boring and monotonous rhythm. As a rule, within a given paragraph, you should try to avoid starting more than two sentences with the same word.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p02">The need for varied sentence formats is a little less obvious but along the same lines. Even if you are starting all your sentences with different words, you could still fall into the trap of having every sentence use the same format, thus creating a similarly monotonous rhythm. Typical examples are sentences that all follow the simple subject format of subject–verb–object. Consider the sing-songy rhythm in this example:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p03">Rover had a bone. Princess wanted it. He snarled at Princess. She snarled at Rover. Princess looked to her left. Rover followed her eyes. Princess snatched the bone. Rover started barking.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p04">In the (rather extreme) example, no more than two sentences within the paragraph begin with the same word, but the sentence is still too rhythmic due to the similar format of each simple sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p05">One technique that will help you avoid using the same format is to make a conscious effort to vary your sentence constructions. Consider how the following formats provide interesting variation.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s02_p01">Along with changing the beginnings of sentences, you can add variety by combining sentences, adding words, expanding <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">descriptions</a><span class="glossdef">Depicting something so that readers can get a clear impression.</span></span> or ideas, and creating and moving clauses.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s02_s01_p01">Choosing exactly the right mix of sentence lengths can be challenging. If you use too many short sentences, your writing will be viewed as simplistic. If you use too many long sentences, your writing will be considered convoluted. Even if you use all medium-length sentences, your writing might be dubbed as monotonous. The trick is to use a variety of sentence lengths. If you find you have too many short, choppy sentences, you can combine some of them to add a little variety.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Starting with an Introduction or a Transition</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s08_s01_p01">Each paragraph needs to start with an introduction, a transition, or a combination of the two. The first sentence of a paragraph always has to help a reader move smoothly from the last paragraph. Sometimes two paragraphs are close enough in content that a transition can be implied without actually using transition words. Other times, specific transitions are needed. When no transition is used, an introductory sentence is needed so the reader knows what is going on. If a transition sentence is used, it is logical to follow it with an introductory sentence or to have one joint sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s08_s01_p02">Here are some examples:</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">A transition sentence:</strong> Canned goods are not the only delicious foods available at a farmers’ market.</li>

If another main idea comes up as you are drafting a paragraph, it is most likely time to start a new paragraph. If in revising a draft you notice that a paragraph has wandered into another main idea, you should consider splitting it into two paragraphs. The main idea should be clear and obvious to readers and is typically presented within the topic sentence. The topic sentence is, in essence, a one-sentence summary of the point of the paragraph. The topic sentence is often the first sentence in a paragraph, but it does not have to be located there.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s08_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Building around a Topic Sentence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s08_s03_p01">While the main idea is presented within the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">topic sentence</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that presents the main idea of a paragraph.</span></span>, the rest of the sentences in the paragraph support it. The other sentences should present details that clarify and support the topic sentence. Together, all the sentences within the paragraph should flow smoothly so that readers can easily grasp its meaning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s08_s03_p02">When you choose sentences and ideas to support the topic sentence, keep in mind that paragraphs should not be overly long or overly short. A half page of double-spaced text is a nice average length for a paragraph. At a minimum, unless you are aiming for a dramatic effect, a paragraph should include at least three sentences. Although there is really no maximum size for a paragraph, keep in mind that lengthy paragraphs create confusion and reading difficulty. For this reason, try to keep all paragraphs to no more than one double-spaced page (or approximately 250 words).</p>

The smell of green beans meshes with the smell of strawberries and the vibrant colors of nature are everywhere. You might find that you even have a little garden dirt on your shoes.</td>

The freshness of the foods will make your dishes taste and look better. The excitement of finding something new at the market will translate to eagerness to try it out within a meal.

You can choose to compare and contrast by selecting a trait, explaining how each thing relates, and then moving on to another trait (alternating organization, as here). Or for more complex comparisons and contrasts, you can describe all the features of one thing in one or more paragraphs and then all the features of the other thing in one or more paragraphs (block organization).</td>
                        <td>Tomatoes purchased at the farmers’ market are almost totally different from tomatoes purchased in a grocery store. To begin with, although tomatoes from both sources will mostly be red, the tomatoes at the farmers’ market are a brighter red than those at a grocery store. That doesn’t mean they are shinier—in fact, grocery store tomatoes are often shinier since they have been waxed. You are likely to see great size variation in tomatoes at the farmers’ market, with tomatoes ranging from only a couple of inches across to eight inches across. By contrast, the tomatoes in a grocery store will be fairly uniform in size. All the visual differences are interesting, but the most important difference is the taste. The farmers’ market tomatoes will be bursting with flavor from ripening on the vine in their own time. The grocery store tomatoes are often close to flavorless. Unless you have no choice, you really should check out a farmers’ market the next time you’re shopping for fresh produce.</td>

It might seem odd to see a fruit you have never heard of before, but pluots are relatively new in the fruit world. A pluot is a hybrid fruit created from joining an apricot and a plum. Pluots range in size from that of a small apricot to that of a large plum. The outer skin varies in color from sort of cloudy golden to cloudy purplish. Overall, a pluot looks and tastes more like a plum than an apricot, although the skins are less tart than those of typical plums.</td>

The women aren’t wearing makeup and the men have not necessarily shaved in a few days. They are eager to share information and samples without applying any sales pressure.

It is not uncommon to see kumquat jam and garlic spears. The farmers’ market is truly an adventuresome way to shop for food.</td>

Actually, my foot nearly happened upon him, but I stopped just in time to pull back and spare him. As I stooped to look at him, he scampered up over the top of a watermelon and out of sight. Glancing behind the melon, I saw that the lizard had a friend. I watched them bopping their heads at each other and couldn’t help but wonder if they were communicating. Perhaps the one was telling the other about the big brown thing that nearly crashed down upon him. For him, I expect it was a harrowing moment. For me, it was just another charming trip to the farmers’ market.</td>

Since the market is such an asset to our community, a committee formed to look for a new location. The first idea was to close a street off for a few hours each Saturday morning. Unfortunately, the city manager nixed that idea since he believed that too many people would complain. Barry Moore suggested that the market could be held in the state park that is just a few miles out of town. Again, a government worker struck down the idea. This time, the problem was that for-profit events are not allowed in state parks. Finally, I came up with the perfect idea, and our government blessed the idea. Since the high school is closed on Saturday, we will be having the market in the school parking lot.</td>

Even when they are just starting out in pots, they need plenty of light, air, and heat. Make sure to warm up the ground in advance by covering it in plastic sheeting for a couple of weeks. When you are ready to plant them in soil, plant them deeply enough so they can put down some strong roots. Mulch next, and once the stems of the tomato plants have reached a few inches in height, cut off the lower leaves to avoid fungi. Carefully prune the suckers that develop in the joints of the developing stems.</td>

So I bought it and added it to my lettuce bag. The flower was so big that I had to hold the bag right in front of me to keep it from being bumped. At the Wilson Pork Farm booth, I tasted a little pulled pork. You guessed it—I had to buy a quart of it. I went on with a plastic quart container in my left hand and my lettuce and flower in my right hand. I was handling it all just fine until I saw a huge hanging spider plant I had to have. Ever so gently, I placed my pulled pork container inside the spider fern plant pot. Now I was holding everything right in front of me as I tried to safely make my way through the crowd. That’s when I met up with little Willie. Willie was about seven years old and he was playing tag with his brother. I’m not sure where their mother was, but Willie came running around the corner and smacked right into me. You are probably thinking that poor Willie had pulled pork all over his clothes and an upside-down plant on his head. But no, not at all. That was me. Willie didn’t even notice. He was too busy chasing his brother.</td>

It benefited greatly from the installation of permanent booths, electrical outlets, and a ready water supply. These amenities drew far more customers and merchants. Its popularity reached unprecedented levels by 2000, when the city offered to help with the staffing needed to keep it open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturdays and from noon to 5 p.m. on Sundays.
