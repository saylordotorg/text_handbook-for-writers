    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_p01">As part of the process of applying for any job in any profession beyond the entry level, you are likely to have to produce two main written documents: a résumé and a cover letter or letter of application. Writing these documents well is often a key determiner in whether you get the job. To illustrate, we’ll follow a student, Joey Williams, through these two key professional writing challenges. Joey is a recent graduate of a master’s degree program in public relations who is seeking a position at a graphic design firm.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Solid Résumés</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Common résumé formats vary with types of jobs and with the times, but regardless of the type of position you are seeking, your résumé should include some key features and some key information.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Key Résumé Features</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p01">Effective résumés have the following features:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>They are meticulously edited (absolutely no errors).</li>
                <li>The subheadings stand out and are short enough to be read at a glance (one or two words).</li>
                <li>Ample white space is used.</li>
                <li>Lists are parallel.</li>
                <li>Bolding is used sparingly.</li>
                <li>One easy-to-read font is uniformly used throughout.</li>
                <li>The font is size 12.</li>
                <li>The résumé is available both in digital and hard-copy form.</li>
                <li>Formatting on a digital résumé holds when it is opened in others’ computers. This formatting should be straight type without tabbing, tables, italics, bolding, columns, or indenting. If it’s included as an attachment, it should be in a Microsoft Word file. A second option is to visually create the résumé as desired and then capture it in a PDF file.</li>
                <li>The résumé is confined to one page unless you are in a profession that requires additional pages or unless you are at a more advanced professional level that requires a more extensive résumé.</li>
                <li>The most recent information is presented first within each category.</li>
                <li>Standard résumé paper is used unless the specific profession calls for something different.</li>
                <li>Accomplishments are presented in nonwordy formats.</li>
                <li>Action verbs are used to describe accomplishments.</li>
                <li>Contact information is clearly visible at the top of the résumé.</li>
                <li>Key words that searchers in your professional field are likely to use are included in résumés that are posted online. (After your contact information, include a “key words” section or weave the keywords into your accomplishments.)</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Key Résumé Information</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01">Every résumé should include the following information:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>professional name</li>
                <li>address</li>
                <li>phone number</li>
                <li>e-mail address</li>
                <li>work experience (i.e., places of employment)</li>
                <li>accomplishments at each place of employment</li>
                <li>education</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">These résumé components are optional:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>personal interests</li>
                <li>references</li>
                <li>dates of education and work experience</li>
                <li>address for personal website</li>
                <li>employment objective (a good strategy if you want to tailor your résumé for a certain job description)</li>
                <li>fax number</li>
                <li>awards and honors</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p03">To ensure that your résumé is both current and appropriate for the position, you should search online for similar sample résumés. You should also run your résumé past the career placement services at your college and any people you know who are working in your field of interest. Here’s Joey’s generic résumé:</p>
            <div class="informalfigure large block">

    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Targeted Cover Letters</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Along with sending a résumé when applying for a job, you will almost always want to send a cover letter. This suggestion holds true in both hard-copy and digital situations. A hard-copy cover letter should be formatted as a standard, typed business letter (for a sample, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch12#mccrimmon-ch12">Chapter 12 "Professional Writing"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch12_s01#mccrimmon-ch12_s01">Section 12.1 "Writing Business Letters"</a>). A digital cover letter should be either typed directly into a given window or copied and pasted into the window. If you copy and paste, check to make sure that the formatting holds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_p02">When the job market is tight, just getting an interview is a major hurdle. Facing dozens and sometimes even hundreds of applicants, employers are looking for reasons to cut down their pool of potential interviewees. Don’t give them a reason <strong class="emphasis bold">not</strong> to interview you by writing a vaguely worded, overly general letter of application or résumé, especially when you can easily revise and tailor your approach to each position for which you are applying.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_p03">To <em class="emphasis">target</em> a cover letter means to write it specifically for an identified job. You can gather information to target your cover letter by looking carefully at the job description and by studying the company’s website. Let’s look at an example of an online job description that has caught Joey’s attention:</p>
        <div class="callout block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_n01">

Typical contents of the paragraphs of his cover letter might include the following:</p>
        <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">First Paragraph</h2>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_s04_p01">Keep in mind that your cover letter is the first chance to present yourself and often the only chance. Besides being sure to include the most pertinent and valuable information you have to offer, be very careful that your letter is grammatically correct with no punctuation or spelling errors. Proofread it carefully yourself, and then, even if you think the letter is perfect, ask a trusted acquaintance to proofread it. Errors in this kind of high-stakes writing situation can be fatal to your chances of achieving your desired goal: getting your foot in the door professionally.</p>
