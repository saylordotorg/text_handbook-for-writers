    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s05_p01">Switching grammatical direction midway through a sentence can result in writing <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mixed constructions</a><span class="glossdef">A switch in grammatical direction midway through a sentence.</span></span>, which make a sentence difficult to understand. Mixed constructions often take place when you start out a sentence with a thought, shift your thinking midway through it, and then fail to reread your completed or revised thought upon completing the sentence. Another common cause of mixed constructions is the revision process itself, especially as it occurs in word processing. When you are proofreading and making changes, it is easy to change a part of a sentence without realizing that the change does not mesh with the rest of the construction. Sometimes mixed construction sentences can be fixed by moving words around, adding words to the sentence, or both. Other times, the best repair is to turn the sentence into two or more sentences.</p>

            <li>Starting a sentence with one grammatical format and ending with another creates an awkward mixed construction that does not work.</li>
            <li>You can usually avoid mixed construction problems by proofreading your finished work.</li>
            <li>Take extra care to read over each sentence as you are revising since the process of revision often results in mixed constructions.</li>
