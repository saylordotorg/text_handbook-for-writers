In other words, verb tense explains if the action in the sentence took place previously (past tense), is taking place right now (present tense), or will take place some time in the future (future tense). Tense also can indicate continual or recurring action (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">progressive</a><span class="glossdef">Continual or recurring action.</span></span>), action that has completely taken place as of a certain time (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perfect</a><span class="glossdef">Action that took place as of a certain time.</span></span>), and action that began in the past but continues or recurs through the present time (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">perfect progressive</a><span class="glossdef">Action that began in the past but continues or recurs in the present.</span></span>).</p>
