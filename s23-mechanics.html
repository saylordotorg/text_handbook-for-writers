        <h2 class="title editable block">Spell Check</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s01_s01_p01">The combination of extensive computer use and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">spell checkers</a><span class="glossdef">A software program tool that identifies spelling errors.</span></span> have changed the way we look at spelling. Today’s software programs often provide both manual and automatic spell checking. Manual spell checking lets you go through the entire document or selected text from it and checks for spellings not present in the dictionary of reference. Automatic spell checking underlinines spelling errors for you (usually in red). By right-clicking on the misspelled word, you’ll be given one or more correctly spelled alternatives. When you find the spelling you think is correct, clicking on that word will change the text automatically. Sometimes automatic spell checking underlines words that aren’t misspelled, but it rarely misses words that are. So if you check all the marked words, you can “spell check as you write.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s01_s01_p02">Just make sure you don’t rely on spell check to have a human eye. Consider the following sentence: “It was sunny win I drove of this mourning, so I lift my umbrela in the car port.” If you use a spell checker on this sentence, you will be alerted to fix the problem with “umbrela.” You won’t, however, be given any indication that “win,” “mourning,” “of,” “lift,” and “car port” are problems. Spell checkers have no way to tag misspelled words if the misspelling forms another word, incorrectly used homophones, or compound words that are presented as two words. So even though spell checkers are great tools, do not give them the sole responsibility of making sure your spelling is accurate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s01_s01_p03">Spell checkers can also suggest the wrong first choice to replace a misspelled word. Consider the following sentence: “My shert was wet cleer thrugh to my skin, and my shos sloshed with every step.” A spell checker might list “though” as a first-choice for “thrugh” and “through” as the second choice, thus forcing you to know that “though” is not right and to look on down the list and choose “through.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s01_s01_p04">As a rule, only very common proper nouns are part of the dictionaries on which a spell checker is based. Consequently, you are left to check your spelling of those words. Many software programs allow users to add words to the dictionary. This permission lets you incorporate proper nouns you use often into the dictionary so you will not have to address them during a spell check. You might, for example, add your name or your workplace to the dictionary. Besides adding proper nouns, you can also add your list of other words you’ve commonly misspelled in the past.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s01_s05_p02">Many common words in British and American English are spelled differently. For example, American English words ending in -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">er</em> are often spelled with -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">re</em> in British English. American English tends to use -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">yze</em> or -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">ize</em> while British English prefers -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">yse</em> or -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">ise</em>. Words that include the letter <em class="emphasis bolditalic">o</em> in American English are often spelled with an <em class="emphasis bolditalic">ou</em> in British English. American English uses -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">ck</em> or -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">tion</em> as word endings, whereas British English often uses -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">que</em> or -<em class="emphasis bolditalic">xion</em>.</p>

This laxity got its start as a means of expediency since the use of capital letters required additional efforts for people using only a couple of fingers or thumbs for typing words. Rather quickly, the use of abbreviations and lack of capital letters became fashionable—almost like a status symbol indicating a person’s social networking awareness. Despite this now common exclusion of capital letters in personal situations, capital letters are still the proper choice in professional and academic settings. If you are someone who writes far more often on a cell phone than on a computer, you are likely to benefit from a brush up on capitalization rules for those occasions when you are composing more official documents.</p>

An example of an acronym is “FBI” for “Federal Bureau of Investigation.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_p02">Some abbreviations or acronyms require a period (etc.), but quite a few never take periods (IBM or FBI). You simply have to learn these differences through the experience of seeing specific examples in print.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_p03">You need to know two main things about abbreviations: when to use them and how to write them appropriately. The following sections will clarify these two points.</p>

These abbreviations should not be used as stand-alone abbreviations. In other words, you can use the dollar-sign abbreviation to write “$5.00” but not to write “I earned several $ last night.” Some of these abbreviations can be used within text, such as BC, p.m., and CST. Measurement abbreviations, however, should be used only in tables, graphs, and figures and should be spelled out within continuous text.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_s05_p01">If you are writing for an audience that is familiar with a specific vocabulary that incorporates abbreviations—for example, readers with a strong military base—you can use those abbreviations freely. But be aware when you are writing for readers who do not share that common knowledge base that you will have to spell out abbreviations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_s05_p02">Incident-specific abbreviations are created for use in one specific situation and thus require obvious references so the audience can understand their meaning. For example, say you are writing a story about a teacher named Mr. Nieweldowskilty. If you refer to him by his full name once and then note that students call him Mr. Niews for short and then refer to him as Mr. Niews the rest of the time, your audience can easily understand that Mr. Niews is short for Mr. Nieweldowskilty. But if you write a second story about him, you cannot assume that readers will know the abbreviated name, Mr. Niews.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s05_p01">Traditionally, underlining was used as a means of emphasis in handwritten text.

If you are creating text by hand or by some other means where italics are not available, use underlining instead of italics.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s05_s01_p01">As a rule, you should italicize the titles of published works, but you should not italicize parts of published works, such as a poem within a book, or unpublished works. Some exceptions that should be italicized include lengthy works, such as a very long poem within a book, and legal cases. Some exceptions that should not be italicized include titles of published short stories and titles of television shows. Works that are not italicized are typically placed in quotation marks. Some other exceptions that should not be italicized include long religious works, such as the Bible and the Koran, and easily recognizable texts, such as the US Constitution.</p>
