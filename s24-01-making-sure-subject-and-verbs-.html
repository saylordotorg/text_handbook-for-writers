                <li>A typical English sentence has a clear singular or plural subject followed by an equally clear singular or plural verb.</li>
                <li>Take extra care to match subjects and verbs when other words come between them by not using those extra words in your determination.</li>
                <li>Compound subjects always use a plural verb.</li>
                <li>Titles and collective subjects always require singular verbs.</li>
                <li>Indefinite subjects are singular or plural based on their own meaning, the rest of the sentence, or both.</li>
                <li>When a subject comes after the verb, locate the subject by identifying who or what completed the action. Then apply the appropriate subject/verb agreement guideline.</li>
                <li>Use antecedents to decide whether relative pronouns are singular or plural. Then match them to verbs.</li>
                <li>Gerunds and infinitives are always singular and take singular verbs.</li>
                <li>Some subjects look plural whether they are singular or plural. With such subjects, take special care when making sure the subjects and verbs agree.</li>
