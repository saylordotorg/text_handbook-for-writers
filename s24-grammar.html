        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s00_p01">People who are new to the English language frequently encounter rules of grammar that cause confusion, and those struggles are to be expected. But even native English users know that most everyone has issues with grammar sometimes. In this chapter, you will have a chance to review all the basic grammar rules. The first two sections address subject and verb issues. The next three sections cover noun cases and a variety of pronoun rules. The final section presents guidelines for using adverbs and adjectives.</p>

                <li>A typical English sentence has a clear singular or plural subject followed by an equally clear singular or plural verb.</li>
                <li>Take extra care to match subjects and verbs when other words come between them by not using those extra words in your determination.</li>
                <li>Compound subjects always use a plural verb.</li>
                <li>Titles and collective subjects always require singular verbs.</li>

Life would simply be easier all the way around! But we live in a world of variety, and just as you take the needed steps to become familiar with the coffee maker and car you own, you should also take the effort to become familiar with the language you speak. This section presents an overview of common issues that impede the proper use of English verbs. To get ready to understand the possible problems, study the following chart that shows the five main forms of verbs. Notice that for verbs other than <em class="emphasis">be</em>, the present tense for all but third-person singular pronouns is the base verb (third-person singular uses the base verb + -<em class="emphasis">s</em>). The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">present participle</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form created to indicate continuing action by adding present tense form of “to be” to the base verb + -<em class="emphasis">ing</em> (e.g., “We <em class="emphasis">are laughing</em>”).</span></span> is usually a form of “to be” + the base word + -<em class="emphasis">ing</em>, and the past tense and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">past participle</a><span class="glossdef">A verb form created to indicate completed action by adding past tense form of “to have” to the conjugated base verb (e.g., “They <em class="emphasis">had eaten</em>”).</span></span> follow irregular patterns.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s02_s02_p01">Some verbs are especially problematic either because their meanings are confused or because some of their forms sound alike. Handle these verbs by knowing which ones give you trouble and then focusing on the conjugation of those specific verbs. Some of these most commonly troublesome verbs are in the following table. You need to know two key verb types to read this table: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">transitive</a><span class="glossdef">A type of verb that acts on a direct object (e.g., “He <em class="emphasis">hit</em> the ball”).</span></span> (when an object receives the action of the verb; in other words, something is done to something) and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">intransitive</a><span class="glossdef">A type of verb that does not take a direct object (e.g., “He <em class="emphasis">laughs</em>”).</span></span> (a verb that does not act on an object).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s02_s05_p01">Verbals are words formed from verbs that function as other parts of speech. One type of verbals, gerunds (laughing, eating), always function as nouns (e.g., “<em class="emphasis">Laughing</em> is good for you”). Present, past, and present perfect participles are verbals that function as adjectives (e.g., “The sound of <em class="emphasis">laughing</em> children always cheered him up,” “The sight of the <em class="emphasis">broken</em> tricycle left in the rain made him gloomy”). Infinitives (to laugh, to have eaten) are another main type of verbals that function as nouns, adjectives, or adverbs. When using any of these verbals, make sure you match the tense of the verb in the sentence.</p>

Then reword the clause as a sentence and substitute a personal pronoun (subjective case: he, she, they; objective case: him, her, them) for <em class="emphasis">who</em> or <em class="emphasis">whom</em>. If <em class="emphasis">he</em>, <em class="emphasis">she</em>, or <em class="emphasis">they</em> sounds right, use <em class="emphasis">who</em>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s04_p01">Pronouns can be somewhat confusing, but they can help make your use of language smoother and more compact. For example, if your name were Pete Rando, you could write, “Pete Rando is going back to wait to go back to Pete Rando’s camper until Pete Rando’s friends have seen the sunset at the Grand Canyon.” Or you could say, “I’m going to wait to go back to my camper until my friends have seen the sunset at the Grand Canyon.” A first step in understanding how and when to use pronouns properly is having an overall picture of pronouns. Study the following table for an overview of the different types of pronouns. Note that some pronouns, such as possessive pronouns and interrogative pronouns, show up on more than one list.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s04_p02">Another step in properly using pronouns is to recognize a pronoun’s antecedent, which is the noun or pronoun to which a pronoun refers, and make sure the pronoun and antecedent match in number, person, gender, and human versus nonhuman state. Also, to make the antecedent-pronoun match clear, the pronoun should follow relatively soon after the antecedent, and no other possible antecedent should fall between the antecedent and the pronoun.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s06_s03_p01">Most adjectives and adverbs have three levels of intensity. The lowest level is the base, or positive, level, such as <em class="emphasis">tall</em>. The second level is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">comparative</a><span class="glossdef">A word used to compare two things (e.g., taller, better).</span></span> level (<em class="emphasis">taller</em>), and the top level is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">superlative</a><span class="glossdef">A word used to compare three or more things (e.g., tallest, best).</span></span> level (<em class="emphasis">tallest</em>). You use the base, or positive, level when you are talking about only one thing. You use the comparative level when you are comparing two things. The superlative level allows you to compare three or more things.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s06_s03_p02">With short adjectives, the comparative and superlative are typically formed by adding -<em class="emphasis">er</em> and -<em class="emphasis">est</em>, respectively. If an adjective has three or more syllables, use the words <em class="emphasis">more</em> or <em class="emphasis">less</em> (comparative) and <em class="emphasis">most</em> or <em class="emphasis">least</em> (superlative) in front of the adjectives instead of adding suffixes. When you are unsure whether to add the suffix or a word, look up the word.</p>

                <li>The key to using adverbs and adjectives correctly is paying attention to standard adverb and adjective rules, such as the fact that adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs and adjectives modify only nouns and pronouns.</li>
                <li>The comparatives and superlatives of most one- and two-syllable adjectives are formed by adding -<em class="emphasis">er</em> and -<em class="emphasis">est</em>. For adjectives with three or more syllables, the words <em class="emphasis">more</em>, <em class="emphasis">less</em>, <em class="emphasis">most</em>, and <em class="emphasis">least</em> are used with the adjective. Some smaller adverbs form comparatives and superlatives by adding -<em class="emphasis">er</em> and -<em class="emphasis">est</em>, but most of the comparative and superlatives of adverbs are formed by using the words <em class="emphasis">more</em>, <em class="emphasis">less</em>, <em class="emphasis">most</em>, and <em class="emphasis">least</em> with the adverbs. Some adjectives and some adverbs have irregularly formed comparatives and superlatives that you simply must learn, such as <em class="emphasis">good</em>, <em class="emphasis">better</em>, and <em class="emphasis">best</em>.</li>
                <li>Double negatives within a sentence reverse the negative state and turn the negative connotation into a positive one.</li>
                <li>It is wise to pay close attention to the guidelines for using the adverbs and adjectives <em class="emphasis">good</em>, <em class="emphasis">well</em>, <em class="emphasis">bad</em>, and <em class="emphasis">badly</em> since their use is both irregular and somewhat ambiguous.</li>
