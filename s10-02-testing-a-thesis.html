The purpose of the test is to satisfy yourself that your thesis will work well. To test your satisfaction, answer the following questions. Read the tips if you need some help answering the questions.</p>
    <div class="exercises editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Questions</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #1:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">interesting</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p03">Tip: When you read the thesis statement, do you find yourself wondering about different aspects of the topic? In other words, do you want to know the answer to the thesis question? Do you think others will also want to know?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #2:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">arguable</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p05">Tip: If you are writing an argumentative essay and developing a thesis for a topic that is controversial, make sure you can also formulate in your head what the thesis for “the other side” would sound like.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #3:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">specific</strong> enough?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p07">Tip: Make certain that your thesis addresses a specific point about a specific person, place, idea, or situation. Do not proceed with vague wording, such as “all over the world,” “many people,” or “will cause problems.” Avoid relying too much on qualitative, superlative, or hyperbolic language, such as excellent, awesome, interesting, sad, or silly. Such words do not carry any concrete meaning.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #4:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">manageable</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p09">Tip: If you would have to research for two solid months to cover the breadth of the thesis, it is not suitable for a five-page paper. On the other hand, if a reader can understand the whole point simply by reading the thesis, the thesis is not suitable.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p10"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #5:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">researchable</strong>?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p11">Tip: Make sure you are confident that you will be able to find the information you need. Proceeding when you think you will have trouble finding enough information can cost you a lot of time if you come to a point where you think you have to start over.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p12"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #6:</strong> Is your proposed thesis <strong class="emphasis bold">significant</strong> to you and others?</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p13">Tip: If you choose a thesis that you care deeply about, others are likely to also find it significant. After you determine that your thesis is something about which you care deeply, you should double-check that your desired audience will also care.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s02_p14">After you have chosen a topic and a thesis and have begun work on the essay, you will be invested in your idea, so it won’t be as easy to answer these questions objectively. But doing so early on is worth the effort since the process will likely result in a more successful essay in the long run.</p>

            <li>You should test your thesis for your satisfaction that your thesis will work well.</li>
            <li>To test a thesis, you need to ask questions to determine whether it is sufficiently interesting, arguable, specific, manageable, researchable, and significant.</li>
            <li>The thesis-testing process requires effort but will likely result in your satisfaction and a more successful essay.</li>
