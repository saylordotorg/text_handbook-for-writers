    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_p01">This chapter will help you put into practice the strategies of mindful and reflective questioning introduced in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>. After surveying a <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02_s01#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong>, you will learn what can be accomplished from using critical thinking methods when reading texts closely and carefully. You will also see how a single text can be opened up through careful and close reading as a model for what can be done with texts from a wide variety of media and genres. You’ll learn to be attentive to not only <strong class="emphasis bold">what</strong> a text is trying to say but also <strong class="emphasis bold">how</strong> it is saying it. By deepening your understanding of the interactions among self, text, and context, you’ll come to appreciate how crucial your role in the critical reading process is, not only to your comprehension, but also to your genuine enjoyment of any text.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p01">Given that the focus of this chapter is on reading texts, the first section introduces a <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong>. Think of this alphabetical, annotated collection of websites as an alternative collection of readings to which you and your instructor can return at other points in the course. If your instructor is assigning a traditional, bound reader in addition to this handbook, these sites might be purely supplemental, but if not, they might serve as a storehouse from which to build a free do-it-yourself reader that could be central to the work you do in your composition course.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p02">Regardless of how you use these archives of texts, they’re meant to inspire you and your instructor to go on a scavenger hunt for other authoritative collections on the web. If your instructor is using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">course management system</a><span class="glossdef">A web-based learning environment that organizes the work of a course (e.g., Blackboard).</span></span> (like Blackboard) or a class-wide <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wiki</a><span class="glossdef">An interactive, shared website featuring content that can be edited by many users.</span></span>, these sites could easily be lodged in a document library of external links, and you and your instructor could add sites as you discover (and annotate) them. (Or, of course, additional sites may be added to this very chapter by your instructor through <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>’s customization feature.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p03">This collection of web-based archives, even though it references several million texts, merely scratches the surface of the massive amount of material that’s freely available on the web. Remember, too, that your college library has likely invested heavily in searchable academic databases to which you have access as a student. Faculty members and librarians at your institution may already be at work creating in-house collections of readings drawn from these databases. (For more on such databases, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07#mccrimmon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Researching"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07_s02#mccrimmon-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Finding Print, Online, and Field Sources"</a> and consult your college’s library staff.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p04">Because these noncommercial, nonpartisan websites are sponsored by governmental and educational entities and organizations, they are not likely to disappear, but there are no guarantees. If links go dead, try your favorite search engine to see if the documents you’re seeking have been lodged elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p05">The selection principle for this gallery is that the sites listed should be free of cost, free of commercial advertisements, free of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">partisanship</a><span class="glossdef">Taking an entirely one-sided point of view about a subject.</span></span> (though multiple sides are often presented), and free of copyright wherever possible. If you’re not bothered by ads, you’ll find a wealth of additional content, much of which will be very useful.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p06">Finally, remember, just because these sites are free of charge and free of copyright doesn’t mean you don’t have to cite them appropriately if you end up using content from them in your writing. See <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22#mccrimmon-ch22" xrefstyle="select: title">Chapter 22 "Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation"</a> of this book for information on how to document electronic texts. You and your instructor also need to be aware of any copyright restrictions on duplicating and redistributing content on these sites. These restrictions will usually be found at the site itself, but when in doubt, consult your college library staff.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p01">“Critical thinking” has been a common phrase in education for more than a quarter century, but it can be a slippery concept to define. Perhaps because “critical” is an adjective with certain negative connotations (e.g., “You don’t have to be so critical” or “Everybody’s a critic”), people sometimes think that critical thinking is a fault-finding exercise or that there is nothing creative about it. But defined fairly and fully, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">critical thinking</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to separate fact from opinion, to ask questions, to reflect on one’s own role in the process of inquiry and discovery, and to pay close attention to detail.</span></span> is in fact a precondition to creativity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p02">Critical thinkers consider multiple sides of an issue before choosing sides. They tend to ask questions instead of accepting everything they hear or read, and they know that answers often only open up more lines of inquiry. Critical thinkers read between the lines instead of reading only at face value, and they also develop a keen sense of how their own minds operate. Critical thinkers recognize that much of the information they read and hear is a combination of fact and opinion. To be successful in college, you will have to learn to differentiate between fact and opinion through logic, questioning, and verification.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p03">Facts are pieces of information that you can verify as true. Opinions are personal views or beliefs that may have very little grounding in fact. Since opinions are often put forth as if they were facts, they can be challenging to recognize as opinions. That’s where critical thinkers tend to keep questioning. It is not enough to question only the obviously opinionated material in a text. Critical thinkers develop a habit of subjecting all textual statements to a whole constellation of questions about the <strong class="emphasis bold">speaker</strong> (or writer), the intended <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audience</a><span class="glossdef">The individual or group being addressed or targeted by a piece of communication.</span></span>, the <strong class="emphasis bold">statement</strong> itself, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">relevance</strong> of it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p04">Considering the speaker:</p>

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p08">Writers naturally write with some basic assumptions. Without a starting point, a writer would have no way to begin writing. As a reader, you have to be able to identify the assumptions a writer makes and then judge whether or not those assumptions need to be challenged or questioned. As an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active reader</a><span class="glossdef">A person who uncovers the biases, preconceptions, assumptions and implications of a text.</span></span>, you must acknowledge that both writers and readers make assumptions as they negotiate the meaning of any text. A good process for uncovering assumptions is to try to think backward from the text. Get into the habit of asking yourself, “In order to make this given statement, what else must this writer also believe?”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p09">Whether you recognize it or not, you also have biases and preconceptions on which you base many decisions. These biases and preconceptions form a screen or a lens through which you see your world. Biases and preconceptions are developed out of your life’s experiences and influences. As a critical thinker who considers all sides of an issue, you have to identify your personal positions and subject them to scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p10">Just as you must uncover assumptions—those of the writer as well as your own as a reader—to truly capture what you are reading, you must also examine the assumptions that form the foundation of your writing. And you must be prepared to do so throughout the writing process; such self-questioning can, in fact, be a powerful strategy for revision (as you’ll see in more detail in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch08#mccrimmon-ch08">Chapter 8 "Revising"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch08_s01#mccrimmon-ch08_s01">Section 8.1 "Reviewing for Purpose"</a>).</p>

            <li>Far from being a negative or destructive activity, critical thinking is actually the foundation of creative, constructive thinking.</li>

It’s almost a given that multiple readings will be required to fully understand a text, its context, and your orientation toward it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p04">In the first annotation, let’s consider Roger (Student A) and Rhonda (Student B), both of whom read the speech without any advance preparation and without examining their biases and preconceptions. Take a look at the comment boxes attached to the excerpt of the first five paragraphs of Kennedy’s Inaugural Address.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p05">Roger does not have any problem with a lack of separation between church and state. Rhonda is unwilling to accept any reference to God in any government setting. Should Roger at least recognize the rationale for separating church and state? Should Rhonda recognize that while the founders of this country called for such a separation, they also made repeated reference to God in their writings?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p06">Perhaps both Roger and Rhonda should consider that Kennedy’s lofty goal of eliminating poverty was perhaps an intentional rhetorical overreach, typical of inaugural addresses, meant to inspire the general process of poverty elimination and not to lay out specific policy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p07">Roger sees war as a necessary evil in the search for peace. Rhonda sees war as an unacceptable evil that should never be used as a means to an end. To hear what Kennedy is saying, Roger probably needs to consider options other than war and Rhonda probably needs to recognize that history has shown some positive results from “necessary” wars.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p08">If Roger and Rhonda want to be critical thinkers or even if they want have a meaningful conversation about the text, they must think through and past their own personal biases and preconceptions. They must prepare themselves to be critical readers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p09">In the next set of annotations, let’s look at what you could do with the text by making several close readings of it, while also subjecting it to the preceding <strong class="emphasis bold">Twenty Questions</strong>.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p10">A careful reader who looks for assumptions and implications of statements will find plenty of them. For example, the beginning of Kennedy’s Inaugural Address includes many assumptions. In your second annotation, you might go on to target some of these assumptions and offer background thoughts that help you identify and understand these assumptions.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p11">Just as you must try to trace a statement back to its underlying assumptions, you must also try to understand what a statement implies. Even when different readers are looking at the same text, they can sometimes disagree about the implications of a statement. Their disagreements often form the basis for their divergent opinions as readers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p12">Take Kennedy’s assumption that the named people at the beginning of his speech deserve preferential attention. Here are some possible implications of the statement you could come up with that result from that single assumption:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_l06">
        <li>People who voted for Nixon are reminded that their candidate did not get elected, which makes these people angry all over again.</li>
        <li>People who voted for Nixon feel somewhat comforted knowing that Nixon and Eisenhower are being recognized at the inauguration, and they are pleased that Kennedy is acknowledging them.</li>
        <li>Supporters of Kennedy hear his recognition of Nixon and Eisenhower as an acceptance of them, and thus they look more favorably on members of the opposing party.</li>
        <li>Supporters of Johnson appreciate that Kennedy mentions him first and believe that he is giving the most respect of all to Johnson.</li>
        <li>Those concerned about the relative youth of this new president appreciate the deference he shows to tradition by making this rhetorical gesture of salutation.</li>
        <li>Those suspicious of the power of the executive branch might wonder why Kennedy addresses the former presidents and vice president by name but gives only the title of the Supreme Court chief justice and the Speaker of the House.</li>

            <li>Virtually any statement carries a set of assumptions (what the writer or speaker <em class="emphasis">assumes</em> in order to make the statement) and implications (what the statement <em class="emphasis">implies</em> to readers or listeners).</li>
            <li>You need to be able to recognize biases and preconceptions in others and in yourself so you can form your ideas and present them responsibly.</li>

            <li>Apply some of the critical thinking methods outlined in this section to <strong class="emphasis bold">another</strong> presidential inaugural address. For a complete collection, check out the Avalon Project in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02_s01#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong> at the beginning of the chapter. Click on “Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents” in the main directory. Videos of all inaugural addresses since Truman’s in 1948 can be found at the C-Span Video Library.</li>
            <li>Presidential inaugural addresses, having developed over more than two centuries, follow a certain set of unspoken rules of a highly traditional genre. After looking at three to five other examples of the genre besides Kennedy’s, list at least five things most inaugural addresses are expected to accomplish. Give examples and excerpts of those generic conventions from the three to five other texts you choose. Or try this exercise with other regularly scheduled, ceremonial addresses like the State of the Union.</li>
            <li>Watch at least one hour apiece of prime-time cable news on the Fox News Channel and MSNBC (preferably the same hour or at least the same night of coverage). Catalogue the biases, preconceptions, assumptions, and implications of the news coverage and commentary on the same topic during those two hours. If guest “experts” are interviewed, discuss their political ideologies as well.</li>
