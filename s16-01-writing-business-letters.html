After all, in today’s professional world, e-mails have replaced business letters as the primary mode of communication. However, many formal situations are still best handled with business letters, whether they are sent on paper or as an attachment to an e-mail.</p>

    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s01_l02">
        <li>Do not use slang.</li>
        <li>Be professional.</li>
        <li>Be concise and to the point.</li>
        <li>Mention a personal connection, if you have one, briefly at the beginning of the letter to create a personalized introduction.</li>
        <li>Use the abbreviation “Enc.” or the word “Enclosed” prior to a list of papers that are included with the business letter.</li>
        <li>Proofread for grammar, punctuation, and spelling.</li>
        <li>Make sure that a letter attached to an e-mail is in a document format that your recipient also uses.</li>
        <li>Use a person’s name in the greeting whenever possible. If you have no way of acquiring a name, use “Dear Sir or Madam” or similar generic, but professional, wording.</li>
    </ul>
