        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s00_p01">Every time you share a final version of your work, even if it’s only with your instructor and classmates, you are publishing it. The last step in writing an essay is deciding how to publish your work. You might be given specific directions from your instructor; you might take your directions from specific style guides, such as the American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA); or you might be free to make your choices about document design. Whichever category your project falls into, the first section in this chapter will give you some helpful ideas. The remaining two sections will present some tips for digital presentations and for presenting orally.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating PowerPoint Slides</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s01_p01">PowerPoint is Microsoft Office software that has nearly become a standard presentation software. When you create PowerPoint slides to present your paper, you should use a small number of slides, typically less than ten. The slides should cover the most important aspects of your paper and should be at least somewhat visual in nature. PowerPoint also presents the option of textual and visual animation as well as audio components. In an effort to keep your slides as visual as possible, place bullets next to sentences whenever possible. Also, use fonts that are large enough for a group to read from a screen: 28 points or larger for base text and at least 36 points for headings.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s01_p02">Allow for ample white space on each slide. Without making the pages overwhelming, use color and visuals to add interest to the slides. If you do not have value-adding images, tables, or graphs that you can use, you can add color to the background, to text, or to text boxes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s01_p03">You can add your voice and other audio to your slides. And you can create a slideshow that you can turn on and run automatically, presenting visuals and sound simultaneously. These capabilities allow you to create your entire presentation and run it without actually saying a word during the presentation. If you intend to run an automatic presentation, make sure you go through practice runs until the entire presentation works as you intend it to work.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Submitting Files Electronically</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s02_p01">Chances are, you will create your paper using Microsoft Word, which has nearly evolved into the standard word processing software in higher education. If you’re not working in Word, save your file as a Word document or in a Word-like format your instructor and peers are likely to be able to open. You will likely be asked to submit your major essays digitally as e-mail attachments or through a digital <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dropbox</a><span class="glossdef">A portal for uploading documents within a course management system.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">file exchange</a><span class="glossdef">Another feature of course management systems allowing students to submit their work.</span></span>, or assignment area within the course management system your instructor or college is using, such as Blackboard. If you are asked to submit your essays digitally, you should assume your instructor and peers will be reading your work on a computer screen and quite possibly online. Therefore, your work can include links and imbedded audio and video components. If, on the other hand, you are asked to submit your essays in hard copy, you can’t make the same assumptions about how it is likely to be read and assessed. There’s nothing wrong with asking for permission to submit your work digitally if you prefer for it to be assessed in that context.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s03_p01">You could present your work on your personal website using web features, such as homepages, navigation buttons, links to other sites, buttons that activate audio and video segments, and overall visual presentations. As a college student, you should only present your work this way when instructed to do so by your instructor. Since not all students have a personal website, this option is still not widely used as a means of presenting college work; however, some instructors are moving in this direction, especially as digital portfolios become an increasingly common expectation. (For more on digital portfolios, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch13#mccrimmon-ch13">Chapter 13 "Writing on and for the Web"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch13_s04#mccrimmon-ch13_s04">Section 13.4 "Creating an E-portfolio"</a>.)</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Working on a Class-Wide Wiki</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s04_p01">Your instructor might have an online class site where you and your classmates can post your papers, review each other’s work, and edit your work. When the due date arrives, your instructor would then read your final version. In this case, your entire paper would function as a digital presentation. Your instructor can read through your paper, follow your links, and listen or watch video and audio segments you have included. Keep in mind that, unlike a course management system requiring a password and enrollment in the course, both personal websites and class-wide wikis may well be visible to anyone using the web. This fact should cause you some concern about the content you share and the way you choose to present yourself and your identity, but it can also provide a meaningful opportunity to write for external, real audiences.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s05_p01">Using video filming equipment, you could film yourself presenting your work and capture both audio and video. You could then upload your presentation to the Internet (via a common video sharing site like YouTube) or you could burn it to a DVD. If you want your digital films to include a variety of multimedia options, you would have to learn how to incorporate such features using the equipment available to you.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s02_s05_l01">
                <li>When using a PowerPoint slide to present your paper, you should use less than ten slides to cover the important aspects of your paper. PowerPoint presentations can include textual and visual animation as well as voice and other audio. PowerPoint gives you the opportunity to create an entire presentation and run it as a slideshow without you saying a word.</li>
                <li>When you present your work digitally, you typically have the option of linking one part of your work to another or linking your work to relevant locations on the Internet. Within digital presentations, you can also often embed video and audio pieces.</li>
                <li>You can digitally share your work by submitting Word files as e-mail attachments; using a digital dropbox, file exchange, or assignment features on course management systems; posting files on your personal website; using class wikis; or filming your presentation and then posting it on the Internet or burning it to a DVD.</li>

That middle ground is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">extemporaneous</a><span class="glossdef">A kind of public speaking technique that works from a set of notes or PowerPoint slides but does not simply read those notes or slides verbatim.</span></span> speaking, based on the technique of speaking from notes.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p02">You can present orally in person or online. If you present orally online, you can do so with just sound or with the use of a camera that allows your listeners to see you. Many laptops include built-in cameras and microphones that make it surprisingly easy for you to create a social, visual presence.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p03">Whether you are presenting in person or online, you need to set yourself up to present without having to remember everything you want to say. One way to create prompters that you can use very smoothly is to use PowerPoint slides that you can show as you talk and that can prompt your memory about what you want to say. When you use a PowerPoint in this way, you only see information your audience is looking at so you never have a problem with trying to look at your notes too much. One grave pitfall to this method is the tendency to read from the PowerPoint slides, which can be very boring for your audience, who also presumably can read. A good oral presentation from PowerPoint should be just as extemporaneous as one delivered from note cards.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p04">If using a PowerPoint is not an option, you can present orally using note cards. When using cards, number them to assure they are in the proper order. Since you don’t want to read your cards, don’t write out your entire speech on the cards. Instead use only cues and place one idea per card so that you can turn to the next card as you transition to the next idea. On your note cards, use text that is large enough for you to easily read at a glance. On the back of the card, add additional details in a smaller font in case you must check out information beyond the basic cue.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p05">When you use a PowerPoint, you can have built-in visuals, but when you use cards, you need to consider adding visuals in the form of items, posters, images on a computer screen (local file or one found on the Internet), handouts, and so on. Display visuals or pass out handouts when you want your audience to look at them, otherwise they are likely to be checking out your visuals when you want them to be listening to you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p06">Keep your audience members in mind when you plan your presentation. Based on their knowledge of your topic, interest in your topic, and attitudes about your topic, decide how basic, how long, and how in-depth your presentation will be.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p07">The amount of preparation you put into the speech in advance will make all the difference. Allow ample time to practice your oral presentation several times. If you are presenting in person or with a computer camera, you might want to record it or practice it in front of a mirror so you can visually see how your presentation comes across and can make desired adjustments. If you have a tendency to talk quickly all the time or when you are nervous, practice talking at a slower pace so your audience will have an easier time following you. Make sure you can consistently talk loudly enough for the whole audience to hear you. If your voice isn’t loud enough, consider using a microphone since an audience that cannot hear quickly becomes unhappy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p08">While you are practicing, keep track of the amount of time your presentation takes so you can lengthen it or shorten it as needed to meet requirements. If feasible, stand while you present so you will make the strongest possible impression. If you are presenting in person, face your audience and make eye contact with your audience members.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p09">Plan to open your presentation with an attention-grabbing comment, visual, activity, joke, story, or situation. If you capture your audience’s attention at the very beginning, you have a chance of keeping it throughout your presentation. On the other hand, if you lose the audience’s attention at the beginning, it will be very difficult to regain it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p10">Keep in mind that you do not have to share every detail of your essay in an oral presentation based on it. Choose a few highlights and focus on them in an effort to give a general idea about your work. Speak directly and personally to your audience, using first-person and second-person pronouns like “I,” “you,” and “we.” Use simple sentences that are easy to follow and include visuals of unfamiliar terms. Stay in tune with your audience so you know when they are keenly interested and would appreciate additional elaboration as well as when they are losing interest, which signals that it would be wise to move onto the next topic.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p11">Conclude your presentation by referring back to the interest-grabbing opener or offering another appropriate anecdote or memorable quotation, phrase, comment, or image. When you finish presenting, ask your audience members if they have any questions. If possible, allow as much time as needed to address all questions. Then thank your audience for their attention to your presentation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p12">If you are nervous about your presentation, keep in mind that nervousness is normal and that it can help bring energy to your presentation. And implement the following ideas to help you remain calm and in control:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_l02">
        <li>Know your material thoroughly so you can easily immerse yourself in talking about it. Then remind yourself that you know the materials and will easily be able to share what you know.</li>
        <li>Write out your opening sentence or two so you get started on track even if you plan to speak extemporaneously for the balance of the speech.</li>
        <li>Stay with your plan. If you nervously start talking aimlessly, you can easily find yourself beginning with points that belong in different parts of your presentation and have a difficult time getting back on track to present your information in the intended order.</li>
        <li>Get all ready and then sit down and relax. Do not start immediately following a frenzied setup period.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_p13">When you are presenting online, keep the following tips in mind:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch10_s03_l03">
        <li>Practice so that your timing is smooth, you know for sure how to use the technology, and your presentation appears polished. If you are using a PowerPoint, make sure each point matches up with the PowerPoint slide that is showing.</li>
        <li>Do not read PowerPoint slides. Your audience can read for themselves. Use your slides to enhance what you are saying.</li>
        <li>Make sure that you have everything you need right by your computer so that you do not have to leave the computer (or the camera) at any time. You can write a script for each slide and read the script while also adding related commentary as it makes sense.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that your audience cannot benefit from any of your facial expressions or body movements if they cannot see you. And even if you are using a camera, they might not be able to see you clearly enough to get information sent through expressions or movements. So be very careful to use words vividly to convey your complete message.</li>
        <li>Talk slowly and enunciate clearly to give your audience the best possible chance of understanding you. People often have trouble understanding speech over the Internet.</li>
        <li>Make sure your audience members know how to get your attention during the presentation if you are planning to allow them to ask questions.</li>
        <li>Look directly at the camera to give the effect of eye contact with your audience members in video presentations.</li>
        <li>Keep in mind that everything you say and every noise you make, such as the screech of a scooting chair, can be heard or seen by the audience. Also, if you have a camera, remember that every facial expression and other things you do can possibly be seen.</li>
        <li>Be relaxed and professional, and most of all, be yourself. You’re not filming a major motion picture or putting on a Broadway show. Think about the kind of voice and image you would want to listen to online or in person.</li>
