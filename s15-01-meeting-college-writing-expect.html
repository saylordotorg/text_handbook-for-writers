            <li>Understand and describe differences between high school and college writing.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p01">If you’re like most first-year college students, you’re probably anxious about your first few writing assignments. Transitioning from being a successful high school writer to being a quality college writer can be difficult. You have to adjust to different learning cultures. You have to accept that college writing is different from high school writing and come to understand how it is different.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p02">These students relay a typical range of first-year college experiences:</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p03">Emma: I always got As on my high school papers, so I thought I was a good writer until I came to college and had to completely rewrite my first paper to get a C–.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p04">Javier: I received an F on my first college paper because I “did not include one original thought in the whole paper.” I thought I was reporting on information I had researched. I didn’t know that I was supposed to add my own thoughts. Luckily, the professor had a policy to throw out each student’s lowest grade of the semester.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl03">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p05">Danyell: The professor in my Comp 101 class said that he didn’t want us turning in anything meaningless or trite. He said that we were to show him that we had critical thought running through our heads and knew how to apply it to the readings we found in our research. I had no idea what he was talking about.</p>
    </span>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_bl04">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_p06">Pat: I dreaded my first college English class since I had never done well in English classes in high school. Writing without grammatical and mechanical errors is a challenge for me, and my high school teachers always gave me low grades on my papers due to all my mistakes. So I was surprised when I got a B+ on my first college paper, and the professor had written, “Great paper! You make a solid argument. Clean up your grammar and mechanics next time and you will get an A!” Suddenly it seemed that there was something more important than grammar and punctuation!</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What’s “Higher” about Higher Education?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s01_p01">Despite the seeming discrepancy between what high school and college teachers think constitutes good college writing, there is an overall consensus about what is “higher” about higher education.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s01_p02">Thinking with flexibility, depth, awareness, and understanding, as well as focusing on how you think, are some of the core building blocks that make higher education “higher.” These thinking methods coupled with perseverance, independence, originality, and a personal sense of mission are core values of higher education.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Differences between High School and College Culture</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s02_p01">The difference between high school and college culture is like the difference between childhood and adulthood. Childhood is a step-by-step learning process. Adulthood is an independent time when you use the information you learned in childhood. In high school culture, you were encouraged to gather knowledge from teachers, counselors, parents, and textbooks. As college students, you will rely on personal assistance from authorities less and less as you learn to analyze texts and information independently. You will be encouraged to collaborate with others, but more to discuss ideas and concepts critically than to secure guidance.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How the Writing Process Differs in College</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s03_p01">It’s important to understand that no universal description of either high school or college writing exists. High school teachers might concentrate on skills they want their students to have before heading to college: knowing how to analyze (often literary) texts, to develop the details of an idea, and to organize a piece of writing, all with solid mechanics. A college teacher might be more concerned with developing students’ ability to think, discuss, and write on a more abstract, interdisciplinary level. But there are exceptions, and debates rage on about where high school writing ends and college writing begins.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s03_l01">
                <li>Requirements and expectations for high school and college writing vary greatly from high school to high school and college to college.</li>
                <li>Some general differences, however, are fairly consistent: College students are expected to function more independently than high school students are. College students are encouraged to think with a deep awareness, to develop a clear sense of how they think, and to think on a more abstract level.</li>

            <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch11_s01_s03_l02">
                <li>Write a brief essay or a journal or blog entry about your personal experience with higher education so far. Consider, especially, what sort of misconceptions you have discovered as you compare your expectations with reality.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Study the following two sets of writing standards. The first is the result of a recent nationwide project to create core standards for language arts students in eleventh and twelfth grades. It outlines what students should be able to do by the time they graduate high school. The second describes what college writing administrators have agreed students should be able to do by the time they finish their first year of college writing courses. What differences do you see? What might account for those differences? How well do you think your skills match up with each set of standards?</p>
