<strong class="emphasis bold">Attitude:</strong> Will my organization make sense to another reader? Does my stance toward the topic stay consistent throughout the draft? If it doesn’t, do I explain the cause of the transformation in my attitude?</li>

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Handling Peer and Instructor Reviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p01">In many situations, you will be required to have at least one of your peers review your essay (and you will, in turn, review at least one peer’s essay). Even if you’re not required to exchange drafts with a peer, it’s simply essential at this point to have another pair of eyes, so find a classmate or friend and ask them to look over your draft. In other cases, your instructor may be intervening at this point with ungraded but evaluative commentary on your draft. Whatever the system, before you post or trade your draft for review, use your answers to the questions in <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch08_s01">Section 8.1 "Reviewing for Purpose"</a>.1 to tweak your original statement of purpose, giving a clear statement of your desired voice, audience, message, tone, attitude, and reception. Also, consider preparing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">descriptive outline</a><span class="glossdef">A plan for an essay written after the fact, describing its organization.</span></span> showing how the essay actually turned out and comparing that with your original plan, or consider writing a brief narrative describing how the essay developed from idea to execution. Finally, include any other questions or concerns you have about your draft, so that your peer reader(s) or instructor can give you useful, tailored feedback. These reflective statements and documents could be attached with your draft as part of a writer’s memo. Remember, the more guidance you give your readers, regardless of whether they are your peers or your instructor, the more they will be able to help you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p02">When you receive suggestions for content changes from your instructors, try to put aside any tendencies to react defensively, so that you can consider their ideas for revisions with an open mind. If you are accustomed only to getting feedback from instructors that is accompanied by a grade, you may need to get used to the difference between <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">evaluation</a><span class="glossdef">Commentary from a peer or instructor usually unaccompanied by a grade.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">judgment</a><span class="glossdef">Commentary from an instructor usually leading to a quantitative assessment (grade) of your work.</span></span>. In college settings, instructors often prefer to intervene most extensively after you have completed a first draft, with evaluative commentary that tends to be suggestive, forward-looking, and free of a final quantitative judgment (like a grade). If you read your instructors’ feedback in those circumstances as final, you can miss the point of the exercise. You’re supposed to do something with this sort of commentary, not just read it as the justification for a (nonexistent) grade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p03">Sometimes peers think they’re supposed to “sound like an English teacher” so they fall into the trap of “correcting” your draft, but in most cases, the prompts used in college-level peer reviewing discourage that sort of thing. (For more on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">peer review</a><span class="glossdef">Reading through text written by a classmate or colleague looking for any changes that could be made to improve the writing.</span></span> process and for a list of <strong class="emphasis bold">Twenty Questions for Peer Review</strong>, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch11#mccrimmon-ch11">Chapter 11 "Academic Writing"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch11_s03#mccrimmon-ch11_s03">Section 11.3 "Collaborating on Academic Writing Projects"</a>.) In many situations, your peers will give you ideas that will add value to your paper, and you will want to include them. In other situations, your peers’ ideas will not really work into the plan you have for your paper. It is not unusual for peers to offer ideas that you may not want to implement. Remember, your peers’ ideas are only suggestions, and it is your essay, and you are the person who will make the final decisions. If your peers happen to be a part of the audience to which you are writing, they can sometimes give you invaluable ideas. And if they’re not, take the initiative to find outside readers who might actually be a part of your audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p04">When you are reviewing a peer’s essay, keep in mind that the author likely knows more about the topic than you do, so don’t question content unless you are certain of your facts. Also, do not suggest changes just because you would do it differently or because you want to give the impression that you are offering ideas. Only suggest changes that you seriously think would make the essay stronger.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_p01">When you have made some revisions to your draft based on feedback and your recalibration of your purpose for writing, you may now feel your essay is nearly complete. However, you should plan to read through the entire final draft at least one additional time. During this stage of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">editing and proofreading</a><span class="glossdef">Reading through text looking for mechanical errors (not content issues).</span></span> your entire essay, you should be looking for general consistency and clarity. Also, pay particular attention to parts of the paper you have moved around or changed in other ways to make sure that your new versions still work smoothly.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_p02">Although you might think editing and proofreading isn’t necessary since you were fairly careful when you were writing, the truth is that even the very brightest people and best writers make mistakes when they write. One of the main reasons that you are likely to make mistakes is that your mind and fingers are not always moving along at the same speed nor are they necessarily in sync. So what ends up on the page isn’t always exactly what you intended. A second reason is that, as you make changes and adjustments, you might not totally match up the original parts and revised parts. Finally, a third key reason for proofreading is because you likely have errors you typically make and proofreading gives you a chance to correct those errors.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_p03">Editing and proofreading can work well with a partner. You can offer to be another pair of eyes for peers in exchange for their doing the same for you. Whether you are editing and proofreading your work or the work of a peer, the process is basically the same. Although the rest of this section assumes you are editing and proofreading your work, you can simply shift the personal issues, such as “Am I…” to a viewpoint that will work with a peer, such as “Is she…”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_p04">As you edit and proofread, you should look for common problem areas that stick out, including the quality writing components covered in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch15#mccrimmon-ch15">Chapter 15 "Sentence Building"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch16#mccrimmon-ch16">Chapter 16 "Sentence Style"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch17#mccrimmon-ch17">Chapter 17 "Word Choice"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch18#mccrimmon-ch18">Chapter 18 "Punctuation"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch19#mccrimmon-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mechanics"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch20#mccrimmon-ch20">Chapter 20 "Grammar"</a>: sentence building, sentence style, word choice, punctuation, mechanics, and grammar (<a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch15#mccrimmon-ch15">Chapter 15 "Sentence Building"</a> through <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch20#mccrimmon-ch20">Chapter 20 "Grammar"</a>). There are certain writing rules that you must follow, but other more stylistic writing elements are more subjective and will require judgment calls on your part.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_p05">Be proactive in evaluating these subjective, stylistic issues since failure to do so can weaken the potential impact of your essay. Keeping the following questions in mind as you edit and proofread will help you notice and consider some of those subjective issues:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">At the word level:</strong> Am I using descriptive words? Am I varying my word choices rather than using the same words over and over? Am I using active verbs? Am I writing concisely? Does every word in each sentence perform a function?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">At the sentence level:</strong> Am I using a variety of sentence beginnings? Am I using a variety of sentence formats? Am I using ample and varied transitions? Does every sentence advance the value of the essay?</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">At the paragraph and essay level:</strong> How does this essay look? Am I using paragraphing and paragraph breaks to my advantage? Are there opportunities to make this essay work better visually? Are the visuals I’m already using necessary? Am I using the required formatting (or, if there’s room for creativity, am I using the optimal formatting)? Is my essay the proper length?</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s02_l03">
            <li>Edit and proofread your work since it is easy to make mistakes between your mind and your typing fingers, as well as when you are moving around parts of your essay.</li>
            <li>Trading a nearly final version of a draft with peers is a valuable exercise since others can often more easily see your mistakes than you can. When you edit and proofread for a peer, you use the same process as when you edit and proofread for yourself.</li>
            <li>As you are editing and proofreading, you will encounter some issues that are either right or wrong and you simply have to correct them when they are wrong. Other more stylistic issues, such as using adequate transitions, ample descriptive words, and enough variety in sentence formats, are subjective. Besides dealing with matters of correctness, you will have to make choices about subjective and stylistic issues while you proofread.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s03_p01">While you are managing the content of your essay and moving things around in it, you are likely to notice isolated issues that could recur throughout your work. To verify that these issues are satisfactorily dealt with from the beginning to the end of your essay, make a checklist of the issues as you go along. Conduct isolated checks of the whole paper after you are finished editing and proofreading. You might conduct some checks by flipping through the hard-copy pages, some by clicking through the pages on your computer, and some by conducting “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">computer finds</a><span class="glossdef">A search for a certain word or phrase within text that is located on a computer.</span></span>” (good for cases when you want to make sure you’ve used the same proper noun correctly and consistently). Remember to take advantage of all the editing features of the word processing program you’re using, such as spell check (described in more detail in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch19#mccrimmon-ch19">Chapter 19 "Mechanics"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch19_s01#mccrimmon-ch19_s01">Section 19.1 "Mastering Commonly Misspelled Words"</a>) and grammar check. In most versions of Word, for instance, you’ll see red squiggly lines underneath misspelled words and green squiggly lines underneath misuses of grammar.
