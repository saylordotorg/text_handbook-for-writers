        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p01">Quotation marks are a key component of written dialogue. All words of a dialogue must be enclosed within quotation marks to indicate that these words are the exact words of the speaker.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">“</strong>The one thing that doesn’t abide by majority rule is a person’s conscience,<strong class="emphasis bold">”</strong> Atticus said.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p03">When you talk about or summarize spoken words rather than presenting them as dialogue, you should not put quotation marks around them since you are not necessarily saying that they are the exact words the person said.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_bl02">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p04">Jem once said that Boo’s dad was the meanest man alive.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p05">As with dialogue, you also should use quotation marks to mark the exact words that you borrow from someone else.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_bl03">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p06">About Harper Lee’s first interview since 1964, Paul Harris writes, <strong class="emphasis bold">“</strong>Lee has regularly turned down every interview request for decades but now, aged 79, has been tempted out of her shell by the University of Alabama.<strong class="emphasis bold">”</strong><span class="footnote" id="fwk-mccrimmon-fn18_001">Paul Harris, “Mockingbird Author Steps out of Shadows,” <em class="emphasis">The Observer</em>, Feb. 6, 2006.</span></p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s01_p07">An exception to using quotation marks around borrowed words is that lengthier quotations of others’ work (those of more than four lines of text) are set in indented block format for the sake of easier readability. Also, if you paraphrase another’s ideas in your words, you need to cite the source of the ideas, but you should not use quotation marks since the words are your own. For more on quoting and paraphrasing sources, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22#mccrimmon-ch22" xrefstyle="select: title">Chapter 22 "Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22_s02#mccrimmon-ch22_s02">Section 22.2 "Integrating Sources"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s02_p01">Italics indicate titles of full-length books and other lengthy, completed works. To separate short works from these longer works, short works are enclosed in quotation marks rather than being placed in italics. Some examples of short works that should be included in quotation marks are articles in periodicals, book chapters or sections, essays, newspaper and magazine articles and reviews, short poems and stories, song titles, titles of television episodes, and titles of unpublished works, such as dissertations, papers, and theses.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s04_p01">Quotation marks can help clarify that a word is being used in an unusual rather than in a straightforward manner. Without the quotation marks, readers might get a totally different meaning from a sentence.</p>

            <li>That course was really challenging.</li>
            <li>That course was really <strong class="emphasis bold">“</strong>challenging.<strong class="emphasis bold">”</strong> (Putting the word <em class="emphasis">challenging</em> in quotation marks lets us know that the sentence is probably using irony to say that the course was not challenging at all.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s06_s04_p02">If you create an original word to fit your specific needs, put the word in quotation marks to indicate to readers that the word is not a standard word.</p>
