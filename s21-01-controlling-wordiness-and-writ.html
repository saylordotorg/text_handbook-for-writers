    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s01_p01">It is easy to let your sentences become cluttered with words that do not add value to what you are trying to say. You can manage cluttered sentences by eliminating repetitive ideas, removing repeated words, and rewording to eliminate unneeded words.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Eliminating Repetitive Ideas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s01_s01_p01">Unless you are providing definitions on purpose, stating one idea in two ways within a single sentence is redundant and not necessary. Read each example and think about how you could revise the sentence to remove repetitive phrasing that adds wordiness. Then study the suggested revision below each example.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Removing Repeated Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s01_s02_p01">As a general rule, you should try not to repeat a word within a sentence. Sometimes you simply need to choose a different word. But often you can actually remove repeated words. Read this example and think about how you could revise the sentence to remove a repeated word that adds wordiness. Then check out the revision below the sentence.</p>
