    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p01">“Critical thinking” has been a common phrase in education for more than a quarter century, but it can be a slippery concept to define. Perhaps because “critical” is an adjective with certain negative connotations (e.g., “You don’t have to be so critical” or “Everybody’s a critic”), people sometimes think that critical thinking is a fault-finding exercise or that there is nothing creative about it. But defined fairly and fully, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">critical thinking</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to separate fact from opinion, to ask questions, to reflect on one’s own role in the process of inquiry and discovery, and to pay close attention to detail.</span></span> is in fact a precondition to creativity.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p02">Critical thinkers consider multiple sides of an issue before choosing sides. They tend to ask questions instead of accepting everything they hear or read, and they know that answers often only open up more lines of inquiry. Critical thinkers read between the lines instead of reading only at face value, and they also develop a keen sense of how their own minds operate. Critical thinkers recognize that much of the information they read and hear is a combination of fact and opinion. To be successful in college, you will have to learn to differentiate between fact and opinion through logic, questioning, and verification.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p03">Facts are pieces of information that you can verify as true. Opinions are personal views or beliefs that may have very little grounding in fact. Since opinions are often put forth as if they were facts, they can be challenging to recognize as opinions. That’s where critical thinkers tend to keep questioning. It is not enough to question only the obviously opinionated material in a text. Critical thinkers develop a habit of subjecting all textual statements to a whole constellation of questions about the <strong class="emphasis bold">speaker</strong> (or writer), the intended <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">audience</a><span class="glossdef">The individual or group being addressed or targeted by a piece of communication.</span></span>, the <strong class="emphasis bold">statement</strong> itself, and the <strong class="emphasis bold">relevance</strong> of it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p04">Considering the speaker:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_l02">
        <li>Who is making this the statement?</li>
        <li>What are the speaker’s affiliations?</li>
        <li>How does the speaker know the truth of this statement?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p05">Considering the audience:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_l03">
        <li>Who is being addressed with this statement?</li>
        <li>What could connect the speaker of the statement with the intended audience?</li>
        <li>Would all people consider this statement to be true?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p06">Considering the statement:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_l04">
        <li>Can this statement be proven?</li>
        <li>Will this statement also be true tomorrow or next year?</li>
        <li>If this statement is true, what else might be true?</li>
        <li>Are there other possible interpretations of the facts behind this statement?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p07">Considering relevance:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_l05">
        <li>What difference does this statement make?</li>
        <li>Who cares (and who should care)?</li>
        <li>So what? What now? What’s next?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p08">Writers naturally write with some basic assumptions. Without a starting point, a writer would have no way to begin writing. As a reader, you have to be able to identify the assumptions a writer makes and then judge whether or not those assumptions need to be challenged or questioned. As an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active reader</a><span class="glossdef">A person who uncovers the biases, preconceptions, assumptions and implications of a text.</span></span>, you must acknowledge that both writers and readers make assumptions as they negotiate the meaning of any text. A good process for uncovering assumptions is to try to think backward from the text. Get into the habit of asking yourself, “In order to make this given statement, what else must this writer also believe?”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p09">Whether you recognize it or not, you also have biases and preconceptions on which you base many decisions. These biases and preconceptions form a screen or a lens through which you see your world. Biases and preconceptions are developed out of your life’s experiences and influences. As a critical thinker who considers all sides of an issue, you have to identify your personal positions and subject them to scrutiny.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_p10">Just as you must uncover assumptions—those of the writer as well as your own as a reader—to truly capture what you are reading, you must also examine the assumptions that form the foundation of your writing. And you must be prepared to do so throughout the writing process; such self-questioning can, in fact, be a powerful strategy for revision (as you’ll see in more detail in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch08#mccrimmon-ch08">Chapter 8 "Revising"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch08_s01#mccrimmon-ch08_s01">Section 8.1 "Reviewing for Purpose"</a>).</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_l06">
            <li>Far from being a negative or destructive activity, critical thinking is actually the foundation of creative, constructive thinking.</li>
            <li>Critical thinkers consider multiple sides of issues, before arriving at a judgment. They must carefully consider the source, the audience, and the relevance of any statement, making a special effort to distinguish fact from opinion in the statement itself.</li>
            <li>Biases and preconceptions are ideas based on life experiences and are common components of most everything you say, hear, or read.</li>

Here are some promising avenues to pursue:</p>
                <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s02_l08" numeration="loweralpha">
                    <li>A public service announcement (PSA) campaign (Ad Council)</li>
                    <li>A “This I Believe” radio essay (This I Believe)</li>
                    <li>A television ad spot from a political campaign (The Living Room Candidate)</li>
                    <li>An entry in one of the debates on a “big question” (Big Questions Essay Series)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Use those same questions for a reading from one of your other classes (even a chapter from a textbook) or a reading in your composition class assigned by your instructor.</li>
            <li>Go to the Smithsonian Institution (SIRIS) site in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02_s01#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong> and click on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Search Collections</strong> tab. Use the search phrase “personal hygiene advertisements” and then choose two of the ads that appear in the archive after you’ve browsed the dozens of hits. Apply this section’s questions to two ads you’ve chosen. Then get to know the search engine on the SIRIS site a little better by trying out a few search phrases of your own on topics of interest to you.</li>
