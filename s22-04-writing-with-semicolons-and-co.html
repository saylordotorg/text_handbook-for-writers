    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s04_p01">By the time you were taught how to use semicolons and colons in eighth grade or so, you were likely already set in your ways regarding punctuation. Here’s the good news: it isn’t too late to add these marks to your commonly used list and to appreciate how much they can do for your writing.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s04_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Semicolons</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s04_s01_p01">A semicolon is a punctuation mark that signals a pause that is stronger than a comma but weaker than a period. Appropriately, a semicolon (;) looks like a period on top of a comma. The standard uses for semicolons are to separate two independent clauses instead of using coordinating conjunctions, to separate two independent clauses along with a conjunctive adverb, or to clarify a series that includes other punctuation.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Compound Sentences without Coordinating Conjunctions or with Conjunctive Adverbs</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s04_s01_s01_p01">Compound sentences with conjunctive adverbs or without coordinating conjunctions require a semicolon.

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s04_s01_s02_p01">Typically, commas separate items in a series. Sometimes multiple-word series items include commas. In these cases, the commas within the items would be easily confused with the commas that separate the items. To avoid this confusion, you should use semicolons between these series items. You should not use semicolons to separate items in a series when the items do not include commas.</p>
