    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p01">When you are researching for an essay, your attitude and stamina are key to your success. If you let either of these issues get out of hand, you can seriously weaken your project. Before you begin what is essentially a month-long relationship with a topic, you should choose something that interests you, something about which you have an opinion. Even when it is on a topic you care deeply about, researching is often tedious and demands stamina. Assume from the beginning that the project will be time consuming and sometimes exhausting, so make sure to allot the needed time and energy to complete it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p02">If you feel strongly about a topic, you might find it a challenge to keep your attitude in check and to read your sources with an open mind. It is critical not to let your personal opinions drive the information you choose to include. Try to create a well-rounded paper. If all the sources you find appear to agree with your viewpoints, actively search out a different viewpoint to strengthen your paper. Or consider changing your path entirely because if there really isn’t a range of sources out there, you’re probably not working with an arguable topic. (See <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch06#mccrimmon-ch06">Chapter 6 "Drafting"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch06_s02#mccrimmon-ch06_s02">Section 6.2 "Testing a Thesis"</a> for more on how to test a thesis or topic for whether it is arguable.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p03">Along with keeping an open mind (attitude) and keeping to a schedule (stamina), you should, of course, read critically, using some of the guidelines discussed in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02#mccrimmon-ch02">Chapter 2 "Becoming a Critical Reader"</a>. In other words, you should evaluate the arguments and assumptions authors make and, when appropriate, present your evaluations within your paper. You can include biased information if you choose, but be certain to note the bias. This move might be appropriate in a persuasive essay if you are taking issue with a source with which you disagree. But be careful not to settle for too easy a target in such an essay. Don’t pick on a fringe voice in the opposing camp when there’s a more reasonable argument that needs to be dealt with fairly. If a source is simply too biased to be useful even as an opposing argument, then you may choose not to include it as part of your essay. Your basic principle of selection for a source, regardless of whether you agree with it as a matter of opinion, should be based on whether you think the information includes sound assumptions, meaningful evidence, and logical conclusions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s04_p04">You also need to pose productive questions throughout the process, using some of the guidelines in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>. If you are writing on a topic about which you already have a very clear stance, consider whether there is common ground you share with your ideological opponents that might lead to a more productive use of your time and theirs. In general, persuasive essays are more effective if they also solve problems instead of just staking out an inflexible position based on a core set of inflexible assumptions. It’s not that you shouldn’t write about abortion or capital punishment if these issues mean something to you. It’s just that you don’t want to go down the same path that’s been followed by millions of students who have come before you. So how do you ask fresh questions about classic topics? Often by rewinding to the causes of the effects people typically argue about or simply by pledging to report the facts of the matter in depth.</p>
