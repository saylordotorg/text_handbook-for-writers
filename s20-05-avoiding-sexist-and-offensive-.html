    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s05_p01">The rights of women have changed dramatically over the past few decades. Slowly, written English has started to reflect those changes. No longer is it considered appropriate to refer to a “female engineer” or a “male nurse.” It is also unacceptable to refer generically to a doctor as “him,” a teacher as “her,” or a politician as “him.” Such usage is considered to be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexist language</a><span class="glossdef">Words that suggest that a given situation or role is attributable to members of only one sex (e.g., mailman).</span></span>. You can use acceptable <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonsexist language</a><span class="glossdef">Words that suggest that a given situation or role is attributable to members of both sexes (e.g., mail carrier).</span></span> by using passive voice (see the example in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch16_s02#mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s05">Section 16.2.5 "Using Passive Voice"</a>), using plural formats (see the examples in <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch16_s05_s01">Section 16.5.1 "Using Plural Format"</a>), eliminating pronouns, switching to direct address, and choosing nonsexist terms whenever possible. An option of last resort is to use “his or her,” “his/her,” “her or his,” or “her/his” or even to alternate “his” and “her” throughout a text, though this path is stylistically awkward and usually unnecessary given the other options available to you.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Plural Format</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s05_s01_p01">By using plural nouns instead of singular nouns, you can switch from sex-specific singular pronouns to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">gender-neutral pronouns</a><span class="glossdef">A pronoun that is neither female nor male (e.g., they, it).</span></span>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing Nonsexist Terms</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s05_s04_p01">One of the best methods of solving the sexist language problem is to choose nonsexist terms. With a little practice, you can learn to naturally use the currently preferred nonsexist language rather than terms that are no longer acceptable. Study the following table for some examples.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s05_s05_p01">Whether language is offensive depends entirely on the audience. If the audience or part of the audience views the wording as offensive, then the wording is offensive. To avoid inadvertent offensive text, adhere to the following general guidelines.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s05_s05_l01">
            <li>Use currently accepted terminology when referencing groups of people. If you are writing about a group of people and you are unsure of the proper terminology, research the most recent usage patterns before you write.</li>
            <li>Be sensitive when referencing people with disabilities by using a “<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">people first</a><span class="glossdef">Wording that recognizes people before conditions of the people (e.g., “person who is blind” as opposed to “blind person”).</span></span>” approach. For example, say “a person who uses a wheelchair” instead of “a wheelchair-bound person.”</li>
            <li>Do not use profanity or vulgar words of any kind. When in doubt, don’t use the term, or if you must use it as part of a quotation, make clear that you’re quoting it.</li>
            <li>Avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotyping</a><span class="glossdef">Attributing common traits to all members of a group.</span></span> (ascribing positive or negative attributes to people based on groups to which they belong).</li>
