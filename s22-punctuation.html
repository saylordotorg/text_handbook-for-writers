        <h2 class="title editable block">A Universal Challenge</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s00_p01">Almost everyone finds punctuation challenging at least occasionally. Although it might be unrealistic to know the correct punctuation in every situation, you can certainly learn to make the correct choice most of the time. When you are uncertain, don’t guess. Handbooks such as this one, as well as a variety of websites, are close at hand. Take the time to look up a rule when you are not sure.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s00_p02">Sometimes, as with many other features of grammar and mechanics, you may look up a rule and find more than one answer or even a raging debate about what is currently acceptable. That’s because usage (the way people actually use a living language) changes over time, thus muddying the rules. But by doing your research, at least the choices you make will be within an accepted range of options.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s04_p01">To create interest and increase clarification, you may want to add words and phrases to basic sentences. These additional pieces often function as add-ons that are not essential to the core meaning of the sentence and do not change the meaning of the sentence. You should separate such words and phrases from the rest of the sentence. Some examples of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonessential words</a><span class="glossdef">A word that is in a sentence but could be removed without changing the core meaning of the sentence.</span></span> include adjective phrases and clauses, words of direct address, interjections, and appositives.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s01_s04_s01_p01">Some adjective phrases and clauses are essential to the meaning of a sentence and some are not. If they are essential, no comma is needed. If the meaning of the sentence would be intact if the phrase or clause were removed, a comma is needed. You can identify adjective clauses since they often begin with the relative pronouns <em class="emphasis bolditalic">where</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">when</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">which</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">who</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">whom</em>, <em class="emphasis bolditalic">whose</em>, or <em class="emphasis bolditalic">that</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s04_s01_p01">A semicolon is a punctuation mark that signals a pause that is stronger than a comma but weaker than a period. Appropriately, a semicolon (;) looks like a period on top of a comma. The standard uses for semicolons are to separate two independent clauses instead of using coordinating conjunctions, to separate two independent clauses along with a conjunctive adverb, or to clarify a series that includes other punctuation.</p>

A comma should not be used immediately before an opening parenthesis, except in the case of in-text lists (e.g., “We need to (1) go to the bank, (2) buy some cereal at the store, (3) pick up the tickets, and (4) get to the party by 7:00 p.m.”</p>
