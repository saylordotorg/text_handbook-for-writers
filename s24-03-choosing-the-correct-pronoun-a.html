    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s03_p01">One feature that is easier in English than in many other languages is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">noun cases</a><span class="glossdef">The designation of a noun as a subject, object, or possessive.</span></span>. While other languages have changes for the objective case as well as changes based on gender, English nouns do not change form except for the formation of plurals and possessives.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch20_s03_p02">Pronouns in English, on the other hand, have different forms for the subjective, possessive, and objective cases. The subjective case refers to words as they are used in the subject position, while the possessive and objective cases designate words that are used in the possessive and object positions, respectively. Study the following table for an overview of the noun and pronoun cases.</p>

                <p class="para">If you are confused about whether to use <em class="emphasis">who</em> or <em class="emphasis">whom</em> in a dependent clause, try isolating the clause that includes <em class="emphasis">who</em> or <em class="emphasis">whom</em>. Then reword the clause as a sentence and substitute a personal pronoun (subjective case: he, she, they; objective case: him, her, them) for <em class="emphasis">who</em> or <em class="emphasis">whom</em>. If <em class="emphasis">he</em>, <em class="emphasis">she</em>, or <em class="emphasis">they</em> sounds right, use <em class="emphasis">who</em>. If <em class="emphasis">him</em>, <em class="emphasis">her</em>, or <em class="emphasis">them</em> sounds right, use <em class="emphasis">whom</em>.</p>

                <p class="para">In casual usage, some words are sometimes left out, thus requiring a pronoun to do extra work. If you are confused about which pronoun case to use in these situations, think about how the sentence would be written if it were totally complete.
