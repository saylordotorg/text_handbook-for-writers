As you review for purpose, keep in mind that your paper has to be clear to others, not just to you. Try to read through your paper from the point of view of a member of your targeted audience who is reading your paper for the first time. Make sure you have neither failed to clarify the points your audience will need to have clarified nor overclarified the points your audience will already completely understand.</p>

In anticipation of attaching a writer’s memo to your draft as you send it out for peer or instructor review, reexamine the six elements of the triangle that made up your original statement of purpose (voice, audience, message, tone, attitude, and reception):</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Voice:</strong> Does it sound like a real human being wrote this draft? Does my introduction project a clear sense of who I am? Honestly, would someone other than my paid instructor or assigned peer(s) read beyond the first paragraph of this essay?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Audience:</strong> Does my writing draw in a specific set of readers with a catchy hook? Do I address the same audience throughout the essay? If I don’t, am I being intentional about shifting from one audience to another?</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Message:</strong> Are my main points strong and clear? Do I have ample support for each of them? Do my supporting details clearly support my main points?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tone:</strong> Am I using the proper tone given my audience? Is my language too casual or not professional enough? Or is it needlessly formal and stiff sounding? Does my tone stay consistent throughout the draft?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Attitude:</strong> Will my organization make sense to another reader? Does my stance toward the topic stay consistent throughout the draft? If it doesn’t, do I explain the cause of the transformation in my attitude?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reception:</strong> Is my goal or intent for writing clear? How is this essay likely to be received? What kind of motivation, ideas, or emotions will this draft draw out of my readers? What will my readers do, think, or feel immediately after finishing this essay?</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Handling Peer and Instructor Reviews</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p01">In many situations, you will be required to have at least one of your peers review your essay (and you will, in turn, review at least one peer’s essay). Even if you’re not required to exchange drafts with a peer, it’s simply essential at this point to have another pair of eyes, so find a classmate or friend and ask them to look over your draft. In other cases, your instructor may be intervening at this point with ungraded but evaluative commentary on your draft. Whatever the system, before you post or trade your draft for review, use your answers to the questions in <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch08_s01">Section 8.1 "Reviewing for Purpose"</a>.1 to tweak your original statement of purpose, giving a clear statement of your desired voice, audience, message, tone, attitude, and reception. Also, consider preparing a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">descriptive outline</a><span class="glossdef">A plan for an essay written after the fact, describing its organization.</span></span> showing how the essay actually turned out and comparing that with your original plan, or consider writing a brief narrative describing how the essay developed from idea to execution. Finally, include any other questions or concerns you have about your draft, so that your peer reader(s) or instructor can give you useful, tailored feedback. These reflective statements and documents could be attached with your draft as part of a writer’s memo. Remember, the more guidance you give your readers, regardless of whether they are your peers or your instructor, the more they will be able to help you.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p02">When you receive suggestions for content changes from your instructors, try to put aside any tendencies to react defensively, so that you can consider their ideas for revisions with an open mind. If you are accustomed only to getting feedback from instructors that is accompanied by a grade, you may need to get used to the difference between <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">evaluation</a><span class="glossdef">Commentary from a peer or instructor usually unaccompanied by a grade.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">judgment</a><span class="glossdef">Commentary from an instructor usually leading to a quantitative assessment (grade) of your work.</span></span>. In college settings, instructors often prefer to intervene most extensively after you have completed a first draft, with evaluative commentary that tends to be suggestive, forward-looking, and free of a final quantitative judgment (like a grade). If you read your instructors’ feedback in those circumstances as final, you can miss the point of the exercise. You’re supposed to do something with this sort of commentary, not just read it as the justification for a (nonexistent) grade.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p03">Sometimes peers think they’re supposed to “sound like an English teacher” so they fall into the trap of “correcting” your draft, but in most cases, the prompts used in college-level peer reviewing discourage that sort of thing. (For more on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">peer review</a><span class="glossdef">Reading through text written by a classmate or colleague looking for any changes that could be made to improve the writing.</span></span> process and for a list of <strong class="emphasis bold">Twenty Questions for Peer Review</strong>, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch11#mccrimmon-ch11">Chapter 11 "Academic Writing"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch11_s03#mccrimmon-ch11_s03">Section 11.3 "Collaborating on Academic Writing Projects"</a>.) In many situations, your peers will give you ideas that will add value to your paper, and you will want to include them. In other situations, your peers’ ideas will not really work into the plan you have for your paper. It is not unusual for peers to offer ideas that you may not want to implement. Remember, your peers’ ideas are only suggestions, and it is your essay, and you are the person who will make the final decisions. If your peers happen to be a part of the audience to which you are writing, they can sometimes give you invaluable ideas. And if they’re not, take the initiative to find outside readers who might actually be a part of your audience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_p04">When you are reviewing a peer’s essay, keep in mind that the author likely knows more about the topic than you do, so don’t question content unless you are certain of your facts. Also, do not suggest changes just because you would do it differently or because you want to give the impression that you are offering ideas. Only suggest changes that you seriously think would make the essay stronger.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch08_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>You should review for purpose while you are writing, after you finish your first draft, and after you feel your essay is nearly complete.</li>
                <li>Use self-questioning to evaluate your essay as you are revising the purpose. Keep your voice, audience, message, tone, attitude, and reception in mind as you write and revise.</li>
                <li>When you are reviewing a peers’ essay, make only suggestions that you think will make the essay stronger. When you receive reviews from instructors or peers, try to be open minded and consider the value of the ideas to your essay.</li>
