    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p03">When you evaluate a source, you need to consider the seven core points shown in <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch07_s05_f01">Figure 7.2</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p04">A source is <strong class="emphasis bold">relevant</strong> if it can contribute to your paper in a meaningful way, which might include any of the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_l02">
        <li>Supplies support for core argument(s)</li>
        <li>Adds a sense of authority to your argument(s)</li>
        <li>Contributes background information</li>
        <li>Provides other viewpoints</li>
        <li>Offers definitions and explanations that your audience will need for clarification</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p05">When determining if a source is <strong class="emphasis bold">current</strong> enough to use, a general rule of thumb is that a source must be no more than ten years old. In some situations, very few sources exist that were published within the last ten years, so older sources can be used as long as you explain why the use of the older sources is acceptable and meaningful. Or perhaps you may be using older sources to establish a historical record of thoughts and statements on your issue in question.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p06">Before you use a source, you need to satisfy yourself that the information is <strong class="emphasis bold">accurate</strong>. In print sources, you can use the author (if known) and the publisher to help you decide. If you think the author and publisher are legitimate sources, then you are probably safe in assuming that their work is accurate. In the case of online information, in addition to considering the author and publisher, you can look at how long ago the site was updated, if evidence is provided to back up statements, and if the information appears to be thorough. For either print or online sources, you can check accuracy by finding other sources that support the facts in question.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p07">You can deem a source to be <strong class="emphasis bold">reasonable</strong> if it makes overall sense as you read through it. In other words, use your personal judgment to determine if you think the information the source provides sounds plausible.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Reliable</strong> sources do not show <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">bias</a><span class="glossdef">Prejudice or a nonobjective stance.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conflict of interest</a><span class="glossdef">A situation where a person or organization might personally benefit from his, her, or its public actions or influence.</span></span>. For example, don’t choose a toy company’s site for information about toys that are best for children. If you are unsure about the reliability of a source, check to see if it includes a list of references, and then track down a sampling of those references. Also, check the publisher. Reliable publishers rarely involve themselves with unreliable information.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p09">A source is <strong class="emphasis bold">objective</strong> if it provides both sides of an argument or more than one viewpoint. Although you can use sources that do not provide more than one viewpoint, you need to balance them with sources that provide other viewpoints.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_p10">A <strong class="emphasis bold">credible</strong> source is one that has solid backing by a reputable person or organization with the authority and expertise to present the information. When you haven’t heard of an author, you can often judge whether an author is credible by reading his or her biography. If no biography is available, you can research the author yourself. You can also judge the credibility of an online source by looking at <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">address extension</a><span class="glossdef">The last three letters in an Internet address (e.g., <em class="emphasis">.com</em> and <em class="emphasis">.edu</em>).</span></span>. As a rule, you need to be aware that .com sites are commercial, for-profit sites that might offer a biased viewpoint, and .org sites are likely to have an agenda. Take precautions not to be fooled by an address extension that you think would belong to a credible source. Always think and read critically so you aren’t fooled.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_l03">
            <li>A source is relevant to your topic if it supports your argument, adds a sense of authority to your argument, contributes background information, provides a different viewpoint, or offers key knowledge the audience will need. As a general rule, unless you are working with a subject that requires some historical research, a source should be no older than ten years.</li>
            <li>Information within a source needs to be accurate, reasonable, reliable, and objective. Accurate means that the facts are correct, reasonable means it makes basic sense to you, reliable means it is without bias or conflict of interest, and objective means it presents more than one viewpoint.</li>
            <li>A source is credible if the source has the expertise to present the information.</li>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s05_l04">
            <li>Choose a research topic of interest to you. Find one source that is both related to the overall topic and relevant to your specific topic. Describe the relevant role the source could make (support, authority, background, viewpoints, or knowledge). Find a second source that is related to the overall topic but not as relevant to your specific topic.</li>
            <li>Find a source that you think is not acceptable due to not being accurate, reasonable, reliable, or objective. Share the source with your classmates and explain why you have deemed the source as unacceptable.</li>
            <li>Choose a research topic of interest to you. Find two sources with information that relate to your topic—one that is credible and one that is not credible. Explain what makes one credible and the other not credible.</li>
