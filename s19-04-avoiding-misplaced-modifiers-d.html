    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s04_p01">Consider this sentence: “For her birthday, Megan received an attractive woman’s briefcase.” The modifier “attractive” is in an awkward position. The person who wrote this sentence most likely intended to suggest that the briefcase was attractive. However, people reading it or listening to it might easily assume that the briefcase was intended for (or already belonged to) an attractive woman.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s04_p02">Three categories of modifier problems include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">misplaced modifiers</a><span class="glossdef">A modifier that has an awkward, confusing position within a sentence.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dangling modifiers</a><span class="glossdef">A modifier that is placed within a sentence in a way that makes it seem as though it modifies a noun other than the one intended.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">split infinitives</a><span class="glossdef">The placement of a word between “to” and a verb (e.g., “to actually grow”).</span></span>. These three categories, explained in the following subsections, are all similar because they all involve misplacing words or phrases. Understanding the differences between these categories should help you be on the lookout for such mistakes in your writing and that of your peers.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Misplaced Modifiers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s04_s01_p01">The easiest way to clarify which word is being modified in a sentence is to place the modifier close to the word it modifies. Whenever possible, it is best to place a modifier immediately before or after the modified word.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Dangling Modifiers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s04_s02_p01">Often a dangling modifier modifies the subject of a sentence, but the placement of the modifier makes it seem as though it modifies another noun in the sentence. Other times, a dangling modifier actually modifies someone or something other than the subject of the sentence, but the wording makes it appear as though the dangling modifier modifies the subject. The resulting image conveyed can often be rather confusing, humorous, or just embarrassing.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Split Infinitives</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s04_s03_p01">Spliting infinitives refers to placing a word between “to” and a verb, as in “Miss Clark set out to clearly define the problem.” Technically, you should not place the word “clearly” between “to” and “define.” This grammar rule came about in the eighteenth century when people held Latin up as the language standard. Since Latin did not have two-word infinitives, such as “to define,” grammarians wanted to preserve the unity of the two-word infinitives in an effort to make English more Latin-like. The use of split infinitives, however, has become increasingly common over the decades (e.g., “<em class="emphasis">to boldly go</em> where no man has gone before”—<em class="emphasis">Star Trek</em>, 1966). In fact, split infinitives are gaining acceptance in professional and academic writing as well. For your purposes, knowing what split infinitives are will help you know your options as a writer.</p>
