<span class="title-prefix">21.11</span> Adverbs and Adjectives</h2>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p01">Adverbs often end in -<em class="emphasis">ly</em> and modify verbs, other adverbs, and adjectives. As a rule, you should place an adverb next to or close to the word it modifies, although adverbs can be placed in different positions within a sentence without affecting its meaning.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_n01">
        <h3 class="title">Example</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Before the verb:</strong> “He <strong class="emphasis bold">slowly</strong> walked to the store.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">After the verb:</strong> “He walked <strong class="emphasis bold">slowly</strong> to the store.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">At the beginning of the sentence:</strong> “<strong class="emphasis bold">Slowly</strong>, he walked to the store.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p05"><strong class="emphasis bold">At the end of the sentence:</strong> “He walked to the store <strong class="emphasis bold">slowly</strong>.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">Between an auxiliary and main verb:</strong> “He was <strong class="emphasis bold">slowly</strong> walking to the store.”</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p07">Some adverbs, however, have a different meaning based on where they are placed. You should check to make sure that your placement carries the intended meaning.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Example</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p08">“She <strong class="emphasis bold">only</strong> loved him.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">Translation:</strong> “The only emotion she felt toward him was love.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p10">“<strong class="emphasis bold">Only</strong> she loved him.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p11"><strong class="emphasis bold">Translation:</strong> “The only person who loved him was her.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p12">“She loved <strong class="emphasis bold">only</strong> him.” or “She loved him <strong class="emphasis bold">only</strong>.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p13"><strong class="emphasis bold">Translation:</strong> “The only person she loved was him.”</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p14">Some adverbs simply do not work between the verb and the direct object in a sentence.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_n03">
        <h3 class="title">Example</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p15"><strong class="emphasis bold">Acceptable adverb placement:</strong> She <strong class="emphasis bold">barely</strong> heard the noise.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p16"><strong class="emphasis bold">Unacceptable adverb placement:</strong> She heard <strong class="emphasis bold">barely</strong> the noise.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p17">Adjectives modify nouns and in some more heavily inflected languages, the endings of adjectives change to agree with the number and gender of the noun. In English, adjectives do not change in this way. For example, within the following sentences, note how the spelling of the adjective “eager” remains the same, regardless of the number or the gender of the noun it modifies.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p18">The eager boy jumped the starting gun.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p19">The eager boys lined up.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p20">The eager girls eyed the starter.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p21">As in these sentences, adjectives usually are placed before a noun. The noun can be the subject, as in the preceding example, or a direct object, as in the following sentence.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p22">Harold admired his shiny red car.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p23">Adjectives can also be placed after a linking verb. The adjective still modifies a noun but is not placed next to the noun, as in the following example.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_bl03">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p24">The weather was miserable.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s11_p25">When two or more adjectives are used to modify a single noun, they should be used in a set order, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch21_s11_t01">Table 21.1 "Hierarchical Order of Adjectives"</a>. Even though the table shows ten levels within the hierarchy, you should limit your adjectives per noun to two or three.</p>
