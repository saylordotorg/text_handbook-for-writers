        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing without Jargon or Slang</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s02_p01">Jargon and slang both have their places. Using jargon is fine as long as you can safely assume your readers also know the jargon. For example, if you are a lawyer, and you are writing to others in the legal profession, using legal jargon is perfectly fine. On the other hand, if you are writing for people outside the legal profession, using legal jargon would most likely be confusing, and you should avoid it. Of course, lawyers must use legal jargon in papers they prepare for customers. However, those papers are designed to navigate within the legal system.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s02_p02">You are, of course, free to use slang within your personal life, but unless you happen to be writing a sociolinguistic study of slang itself, it really has no place in academic writing. Even if you are writing somewhat casual responses in an online discussion for a class, you should avoid using slang or other forms of abbreviated communication common to IM (instant messaging) and texting.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing to Be Straightforward</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s03_p01">Some writers choose to control meaning with flowery or pretentious language, euphemisms, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">double-talk</a><span class="glossdef">Talk that includes extra verbiage in an effort to camouflage the message.</span></span>. All these choices obscure direct communication and therefore have no place in academic writing. Study the following three examples that clarify each of these misdirection techniques.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Presenting an Appropriate Level of Formality</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s04_p01">Look at the following three sentences. They all three carry roughly the same meaning. Which one is the best way to write the sentence?</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s04_l01">
            <li>The doctor said, “A full eight hours of work is going to be too much for this patient to handle for at least the next two weeks.”</li>
            <li>The doctor said I couldn’t work full days for the next two weeks.</li>
            <li>my md said 8 hrs of wrk R 2M2H for the next 2 wks.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s02_s04_p02">If you said, “It depends,” you are right! Each version is appropriate in certain situations. Every writing situation requires you to make a judgment regarding the level of formality you want to use. Base your decision on a combination of the subject matter, the audience, and your purpose for writing. For example, if you are sending a text message to a friend about going bowling, the formality shown in example three is fine. If, on the other hand, you are sending a text message to that same friend about the death of a mutual friend, you would logically move up the formality of your tone at least to the level of example two.</p>
