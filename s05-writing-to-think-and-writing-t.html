        <h2 class="title editable block">Which Comes First? A Chicken-or-the-Egg Question</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s00_p01">You’ve probably had moments as a writing student when you’ve said to yourself, “I know what I think about this topic; I just can’t get it down on paper.” This frustration comes from the notion that writing comes <em class="emphasis">after</em> thinking, that it merely represents or translates thoughts that are already fully formed in your head. But what if the act of writing helps sharpen your thinking? What if the act of putting thoughts into words changes those thoughts for the better? Are there ways to make that transformation happen consistently enough so that writing becomes not an end but a beginning, not a chore but a revelation? That’s what this first chapter is about.</p>

    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p02">The question sounds simple enough, and you may well have developed some stock answers by now.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p03">I’m here because…</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_l02">
            <li>I want to be a ______________ when I grow up.</li>
            <li>college graduates make more money.</li>
            <li>my parents wanted me to go here.</li>
            <li>my boyfriend or girlfriend got accepted here.</li>
            <li>I couldn’t get in anywhere else.</li>
            <li>I just got laid off.</li>
        </ul>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p04">Maybe the truth is, deep down, that you don’t really know yet why you’re here, and that’s OK. By the end of your college experience, you’ll have developed several good answers for why you were here, and they won’t necessarily look anything like your first stock response.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p05">But what does this personal question about your motivations for being in college have to do with examining the status quo? Well, the first way to learn how to examine the status quo (literally, “the state in which”) is to examine your place in it. By enrolling in higher education, you’re making a choice to develop your skills and intellect beyond a baseline level of proficiency. Choosing to become a college-educated person obligates you to leave your mark on the world.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p06">You’re investing time and money into your college education, presumably for the real benefits it will provide you, but it’s important to remember that others are investing in you as well. Perhaps family members are providing financial support, or the federal government is providing a Pell Grant or a low-interest loan, or an organization or alumni group is awarding you a scholarship. If you’re attending a state school, the state government is investing in you because your tuition (believe it or not) covers only a small portion of the total cost to educate you.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p07">So what is the return a free, independent, evolving society expects on its investment in you, and what should you be asking of yourself? Surely something more than mere maintenance of the status quo should be in order. Rather, society expects you to be a member of a college-educated citizenry and workforce capable of improving the lives and lot of future generations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p08">Getting into the habit of “examining” (or even “challenging”) the status quo doesn’t necessarily mean putting yourself into a constant state of revolution or rebellion. Rather, the process suggests a kind of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mindfulness</a><span class="glossdef">A habit of sharpening your consciousness of your surroundings, attained by posing productive questions, slowing down your thinking, and withholding judgment.</span></span>, a certain disposition to ask a set of questions about your surroundings:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_l03">
        <li>What is the status quo of _________? (descriptive)</li>
        <li>Why is _______ the way it is? (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">diagnostic</a><span class="glossdef">A kind of inquiry meant to figure out why something is the way it is.</span></span>)</li>
        <li>What (or who) made ________ this way? (<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">forensic</a><span class="glossdef">A kind of inquiry about the circumstances that led something to be the way it currently is.</span></span>)</li>
        <li>Was _______ ever different in the past? (historical)</li>
        <li>Who benefits from keeping ______ the way it is? (investigative)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p09">Only after these relatively objective questions have been asked, researched, and answered might you hazard a couple of additional, potentially more contentious questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_l04">
        <li>How could or should ______ be different in the future? (speculative)</li>
        <li>What steps would be required to make _______ different? (policy based)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p10">These last two types of questions are more overtly controversial, especially if they are applied to status-quo practices that have been in place for many years or even generations. But asking even the seemingly benign questions in the first category will directly threaten those forces and interests that benefit most from the preservation of the status quo. You will encounter resistance not only from this already powerful group but also from reformers with competing interests who have different opinions about where the status quo came from or how it should be changed.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p11">These concerns about “going public” with your ideas about the status quo are covered in more detail in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>. For now, before you risk losing heart or nerve for fear of making too many enemies by roiling the waters, think about the benefits the habit of privately examining the status quo might have for your thinking, writing, and learning.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p12">Since we began this section with a discussion about education and your place in it, let’s close by having you exercise this habit on that same subject. For starters, let’s just apply the questioning habit to some of what you may have been taught about <em class="emphasis">academic writing</em> over the years. Here is one description of the status quo thinking on the subject that might be worth some examination.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_n02">
        <h3 class="title">What Is the Status Quo of <span class="token">Academic Writing</span>?</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_l05">
            <li>Writing can and should be taught and learned in a certain, systematic way.</li>
            <li>Writing has been taught and learned in much the same way over time.</li>
            <li>Becoming a good writer is a matter of learning the forms (genres, modes, etc.) of academic writing.</li>
            <li>Students are blank slates who know next to nothing about how to write.</li>
            <li>Writing done outside of academic settings (e-mail, texting, graffiti, comics, video game design, music lyrics, etc.) is not really writing.</li>
            <li>Knowing what you think is a must before you turn to writing.</li>
            <li>Writing is largely a solitary pursuit.</li>
            <li>Good writing can happen in the absence of good reading.</li>
            <li>Using agreed-on norms and rubrics for evaluation is how experts can measure writing quality based on students’ responses to standardized prompts.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p13">Your list might look a little different, depending on your experience as a student writer. But once you have amassed your description of the status quo, you’re ready to run each element of it through the rest of the mindfulness questions that appear earlier in the section. Or more broadly, you can fill in the blanks of those mindfulness questions with “academic writing” (as you have just described it):</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_l06">
        <li>Why is <span class="token">academic writing</span> the way it is?</li>
        <li>What (or who) made <span class="token">academic writing</span> this way?</li>
        <li>Was <span class="token">academic writing</span> ever different in the past?</li>
        <li>Who benefits from keeping <span class="token">academic writing</span> the way it is?</li>
        <li>How could or should <span class="token">academic writing</span> be different in the future?</li>
        <li>What steps would be required to make <span class="token">academic writing</span> different?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_p14">Asking these kinds of questions about a practice like academic writing, or about any of the other subjects you will encounter in college, might seem like a recipe for disaster, especially if you were educated in a K–12 environment that did not value critical questioning of authority. After all, most elementary, middle, and high schools are not in the business of encouraging dissent from their students daily. Yes, there are exceptions, but they are rare, and all the more rare in recent years thanks to the stranglehold of standardized testing and concerns about school discipline. In college, on the other hand, even at the introductory level, the curriculum rewards questioning and perspective about the development and future of the given discipline under examination. Certainly, to be successful at the graduate, postgraduate, and professional level, you must be able to assess, refine, and reform the practices and assumptions of the discipline or profession of which you will be a fully vested member.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s01_l07">
            <li>You don’t have to know exactly why you’re here in college, but you do have to get into the habit of asking, reasking, and answering that question daily.</li>
            <li>Society’s expected return on its investment in you as a college student (and your expectation of yourself) is that you will be in a position to examine the status quo and when necessary, help change it for the better.</li>
            <li>Learning to ask certain kinds of questions about the status quo will establish a habit of mindfulness and will lead to more productive thinking and writing about your surroundings.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s02_p05">We’ve been told there’s no such thing as a stupid question, but to call certain questions “productive” is to suggest that there’s such a thing as an <strong class="emphasis bold">un</strong>productive question. When you ask <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetorical questions</a><span class="glossdef">A kind of persuasive strategy in which the poser of the question already knows the answer or expects a listener or reader to answer in a certain way.</span></span> to which you already know the answer or that you expect your audience to answer in a certain way, are you questioning productively? Perhaps not, in the sense of knowledge creation, but you may still be accomplishing a rhetorical purpose. And sometimes even rhetorical questions can produce knowledge. Let’s say you ask your sister, “How can someone as intelligent as you are do such self-destructive things?” Maybe you’re merely trying to direct your sister’s attention to her self-destructive behavior, but upon reflection, the question could actually trigger some productive self-examination on her part.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s02_p06"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Hypothetical questions</a><span class="glossdef">A kind of inquiry about something that hasn’t yet happened or may never happen; it is meant either to establish a hypothesis or to bait a rhetorical opponent.</span></span>, at first glance, might also seem unproductive since they are usually founded on something that hasn’t happened yet and may never happen. Politicians and debaters try to steer clear of answering them but often ask them of their opponents for rhetorical effect. If we think of hypothetical questions merely as speculative ploys, we may discount their productive possibilities. But hypothetical questions asked in good faith are crucial building blocks of knowledge creation. Asking “What if we tried something else?” leads to the formation of a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">hypothesis</a><span class="glossdef">A theory of a case or situation that lends itself to experimental testing.</span></span>, which is a theory or proposition that can be subjected to testing and experimentation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s02_p07">This section has focused more on the types of genuinely interrogative questions that can lead to productive ideas for further exploration, research, and knowledge creation once you decide how you want to go public with your thinking. For more on using rhetorical and hypothetical questions as devices in your public writing, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s03_p01">Given the fast pace of today’s multitasking world, you might wonder why anyone would want to slow down their thinking. Who has that kind of time? The truth is that college will probably present you with more of an opportunity to slow down your thinking than any other time of your adult life. Slowing down your thinking doesn’t mean taking it easy or doing less thinking in the same amount of time. On the contrary, learning to think more slowly is a precondition to making a successful, meaningful contribution to any discipline. The key is to adjust your perspective toward the world around you by seeing it in much smaller chunks.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s03_p02">When you get a writing assignment in a broad topic area asking for a certain number of words or pages (let’s say 1,000 to 1,250 words, or 4 to 5 double-spaced pages, with 12-point font and 1-inch margins), what’s your first reaction? If you’re like most students, you might panic at first, wondering how you’re going to produce that much writing. The irony is that if you try to approach the topic from a perspective that is too general, what you write will likely be as painful to read as it is to write, especially if it’s part of a stack of similarly bland essays. It will inevitably be shallow because a thousand words on ten ideas works out to about a hundred words per idea. But if you slow down your thinking to find a single aspect of the larger topic and devote your thousand words to that single aspect, you’ll be able to approach it from ten different angles, and your essay will distinguish itself from the pack.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s03_p03">Let’s try this with an excerpt of student writing on high school dropouts that was conducted at warp speed. Either the writer was eager to complete the assignment or she hurried to a conclusion without examining the elements of her topic that she was taking for granted. Every sentence or phrase that could benefit from slower thinking in smaller chunks is set in <strong class="emphasis bold">bold blue font</strong>.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch01_s04_p02">If you’ve encountered mostly traditional writing instruction, you’ve probably been encouraged to make judgments fairly early in the writing process. Well before you have fully examined an issue, you’ve been told to “take a position and defend it.” You might make an effort to understand an issue from multiple sides (a process discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03_s02#mccrimmon-ch03_s02">Section 3.2 "Seeing and Making Connections across Disciplines"</a> and <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03_s03#mccrimmon-ch03_s03">Section 3.3 "Articulating Multiple Sides of an Issue"</a>) only <strong class="emphasis bold">after</strong> you have staked your claim in a half-hearted effort to be “fair to both sides.”</p>

Some evaluative <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rubrics</a><span class="glossdef">A chart with specific domains (or criteria) and scoring norms used to evaluate the quality of something (e.g., a piece of writing).</span></span> for such essays require the presence of a thesis statement by the end of the introductory paragraph in order to earn a high score for organization.</p>
