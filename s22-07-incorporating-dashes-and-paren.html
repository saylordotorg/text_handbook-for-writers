        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Dashes</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s07_s01_p01">Dashes separate emphasis-adding text from the rest of the words in a sentence. You can use one long dash to set apart text at the end of a sentence. You can use dashes before and after the text to set it apart in the middle of a sentence. Here are some uses for dashes:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s07_s02_p01">Parentheses allow you to interrupt the flow of your text to give additional information. They can be used in the middle of a sentence or at the end. Some uses of parentheses include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s07_s02_l01">
            <li>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s07_s02_p05">Specific rules guide using punctuation with parentheses. End punctuation can be placed inside parentheses if the content of the parentheses is a complete sentence. If the content inside the parentheses is part of a larger sentence, the end punctuation should go outside the parentheses. If a comma is needed, it should always be placed outside the closing parenthesis. A comma should not be used immediately before an opening parenthesis, except in the case of in-text lists (e.g., “We need to (1) go to the bank, (2) buy some cereal at the store, (3) pick up the tickets, and (4) get to the party by 7:00 p.m.”</p>
