    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p03">Note that most of these questions can’t be answered until you’ve made a first pass through the text, while others almost certainly require some research to be answered fully. It’s almost a given that multiple readings will be required to fully understand a text, its context, and your orientation toward it.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p04">In the first annotation, let’s consider Roger (Student A) and Rhonda (Student B), both of whom read the speech without any advance preparation and without examining their biases and preconceptions. Take a look at the comment boxes attached to the excerpt of the first five paragraphs of Kennedy’s Inaugural Address.</p>
    <div class="informalfigure large large-height block">
        <img src="section_06/ea5b3c5721cb62cf6866f3ddbda74217.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p05">Roger does not have any problem with a lack of separation between church and state. Rhonda is unwilling to accept any reference to God in any government setting. Should Roger at least recognize the rationale for separating church and state? Should Rhonda recognize that while the founders of this country called for such a separation, they also made repeated reference to God in their writings?</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p06">Perhaps both Roger and Rhonda should consider that Kennedy’s lofty goal of eliminating poverty was perhaps an intentional rhetorical overreach, typical of inaugural addresses, meant to inspire the general process of poverty elimination and not to lay out specific policy.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p07">Roger sees war as a necessary evil in the search for peace. Rhonda sees war as an unacceptable evil that should never be used as a means to an end. To hear what Kennedy is saying, Roger probably needs to consider options other than war and Rhonda probably needs to recognize that history has shown some positive results from “necessary” wars.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p08">If Roger and Rhonda want to be critical thinkers or even if they want have a meaningful conversation about the text, they must think through and past their own personal biases and preconceptions. They must prepare themselves to be critical readers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p09">In the next set of annotations, let’s look at what you could do with the text by making several close readings of it, while also subjecting it to the preceding <strong class="emphasis bold">Twenty Questions</strong>. Perhaps your first annotation could simply be designed to separate statements of verifiable fact from those of subjective opinion.</p>
    <div class="informalfigure large large-height block">
        <img src="section_06/4e4161c38bad0ba27666b92a6e4cbdce.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p10">A careful reader who looks for assumptions and implications of statements will find plenty of them. For example, the beginning of Kennedy’s Inaugural Address includes many assumptions. In your second annotation, you might go on to target some of these assumptions and offer background thoughts that help you identify and understand these assumptions.</p>
    <div class="informalfigure large large-height block">
        <img src="section_06/b7a1bd5750572f0ade40ae8a4d8420cf.jpg">
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p11">Just as you must try to trace a statement back to its underlying assumptions, you must also try to understand what a statement implies. Even when different readers are looking at the same text, they can sometimes disagree about the implications of a statement. Their disagreements often form the basis for their divergent opinions as readers.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p12">Take Kennedy’s assumption that the named people at the beginning of his speech deserve preferential attention. Here are some possible implications of the statement you could come up with that result from that single assumption:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_l06">
        <li>People who voted for Nixon are reminded that their candidate did not get elected, which makes these people angry all over again.</li>
        <li>People who voted for Nixon feel somewhat comforted knowing that Nixon and Eisenhower are being recognized at the inauguration, and they are pleased that Kennedy is acknowledging them.</li>
        <li>Supporters of Kennedy hear his recognition of Nixon and Eisenhower as an acceptance of them, and thus they look more favorably on members of the opposing party.</li>
        <li>Supporters of Johnson appreciate that Kennedy mentions him first and believe that he is giving the most respect of all to Johnson.</li>
        <li>Those concerned about the relative youth of this new president appreciate the deference he shows to tradition by making this rhetorical gesture of salutation.</li>
        <li>Those suspicious of the power of the executive branch might wonder why Kennedy addresses the former presidents and vice president by name but gives only the title of the Supreme Court chief justice and the Speaker of the House.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_p13">You could add more to this list of possible implications, but notice how much you’ve done with the first paragraph of the speech already, simply by slowing down your critical reading process.</p>
    <div class="key_takeaways editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_n03">
        <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_l07">
            <li>Virtually any statement carries a set of assumptions (what the writer or speaker <em class="emphasis">assumes</em> in order to make the statement) and implications (what the statement <em class="emphasis">implies</em> to readers or listeners).</li>
            <li>You need to be able to recognize biases and preconceptions in others and in yourself so you can form your ideas and present them responsibly.</li>

        <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s03_l08">
            <li>Apply some of the critical thinking methods outlined in this section to <strong class="emphasis bold">another</strong> presidential inaugural address. For a complete collection, check out the Avalon Project in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02_s01#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong> at the beginning of the chapter. Click on “Inaugural Addresses of the Presidents” in the main directory. Videos of all inaugural addresses since Truman’s in 1948 can be found at the C-Span Video Library.</li>
            <li>Presidential inaugural addresses, having developed over more than two centuries, follow a certain set of unspoken rules of a highly traditional genre. After looking at three to five other examples of the genre besides Kennedy’s, list at least five things most inaugural addresses are expected to accomplish. Give examples and excerpts of those generic conventions from the three to five other texts you choose. Or try this exercise with other regularly scheduled, ceremonial addresses like the State of the Union.</li>
            <li>Watch at least one hour apiece of prime-time cable news on the Fox News Channel and MSNBC (preferably the same hour or at least the same night of coverage). Catalogue the biases, preconceptions, assumptions, and implications of the news coverage and commentary on the same topic during those two hours. If guest “experts” are interviewed, discuss their political ideologies as well.</li>
