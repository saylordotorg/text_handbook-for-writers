        <li>When you have a group of sentences within a paragraph, read the sentences backward so that no sentence can gain information from the preceding sentence. This technique will help sentence fragments stand out since they will not make sense alone.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p28">Ultimately all these pointers are designed to get you into the habit of asking whether your sentences stand on their own. If you have problems with writing fragments, perform these tests until recognizing what constitutes a sentence becomes second nature to you. When you recognize a fragment, you can turn it into sentence by adding the missing component. Try these examples:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_l03">
        <li>
            <p class="para">This fragment has no subject: Giggling and laughing all the way to school.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p29"><em class="emphasis">One possible way to add a subject and turn this fragment into a sentence:</em></p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p30"><em class="emphasis bolditalic">The girls were</em> <em class="emphasis">giggling and laughing all the way to school.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="para">This fragment has no predicate: A brand new iPhone with all kinds of apps.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p31"><em class="emphasis">One possible way to add a predicate and turn this fragment into a sentence:</em></p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p32"><em class="emphasis">A brand new iPhone with all kinds of apps</em> <em class="emphasis bolditalic">isn’t cheap!</em></p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s01_p33">Just as sentences require a subject and a predicate, they also have boundaries.

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p01">By the time you reach college, you probably have a fairly well-developed sense of whether a sentence sounds right. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons why you should get into the habit of reading your drafts aloud before you submit them for peer or instructor review. Or better yet, ask a friend to read your draft back to you. You’ll be surprised how many careless errors you catch just from hearing them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p02">One key aspect that can make a sentence sound incorrect is if the subject and verb do not agree. In properly written sentences, the subjects and verbs must agree in number and person. Agreeing in number means that a plural subject is matched up with the plural form of the verb. Although the plural of a noun often ends in -<em class="emphasis">s</em>, it is the singular of a verb that usually ends in -<em class="emphasis">s</em>.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Examples</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p03">The <em class="emphasis bolditalic">rabbit hops</em> all around the cage. (singular subject and verb)</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p04">The <em class="emphasis bolditalic">rabbits hop</em> all around the cage. (plural subject and verb)</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p05">Agreeing in person means, for example, a third-person noun must be matched with the proper third-person verb. This chart shows first, second, and third person for a few present-tense verbs. As you can see, most of the verbs are the same in all columns except for the third-person singular. The verb “to be” at the bottom also varies in the first-person singular column. So to match subjects and verbs by person, you could choose, for example, to say “I am,” but not “I are.”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Split Infinitives</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s04_s03_p01">Spliting infinitives refers to placing a word between “to” and a verb, as in “Miss Clark set out to clearly define the problem.” Technically, you should not place the word “clearly” between “to” and “define.” This grammar rule came about in the eighteenth century when people held Latin up as the language standard. Since Latin did not have two-word infinitives, such as “to define,” grammarians wanted to preserve the unity of the two-word infinitives in an effort to make English more Latin-like. The use of split infinitives, however, has become increasingly common over the decades (e.g., “<em class="emphasis">to boldly go</em> where no man has gone before”—<em class="emphasis">Star Trek</em>, 1966). In fact, split infinitives are gaining acceptance in professional and academic writing as well. For your purposes, knowing what split infinitives are will help you know your options as a writer.</p>

Mixed constructions often take place when you start out a sentence with a thought, shift your thinking midway through it, and then fail to reread your completed or revised thought upon completing the sentence. Another common cause of mixed constructions is the revision process itself, especially as it occurs in word processing. When you are proofreading and making changes, it is easy to change a part of a sentence without realizing that the change does not mesh with the rest of the construction. Sometimes mixed construction sentences can be fixed by moving words around, adding words to the sentence, or both. Other times, the best repair is to turn the sentence into two or more sentences.</p>

            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s06_s03_p15"><strong class="emphasis bold">Explanation:</strong> Collective nouns are singular since they represent, for example, one team, one crowd, or one family. Although the pronoun “it” is used for nonhuman reference, it can also be used to reference a singular collective noun that involves humans.</p>
