        <h2 class="title editable block">Using Periods</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s08_s01_p01">Periods have three main uses: punctuating many abbreviations, marking the end of many sentences, and separating components in reference citations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s08_s01_p02">Some abbreviations take periods all the time, while some never take periods. You simply have to learn the category of each abbreviation or look them up as you use them.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s08_s02_p01">Question marks have one main use: to end sentences that ask direct questions. They are also sometimes used to indicate questions in a series.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s08_s02_p04">When you choose to use a question mark at the end of a sentence, make sure the sentence is actually a sentence since some sentences give a sense of being a question when they are not. Such sentences are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">indirect questions</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence that gives the sense of being a question when it really is not a question.</span></span>.</p>
