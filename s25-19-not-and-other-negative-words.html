    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p01">To form a negative in English, you have to add a negative word to the sentence. Some of the negative words in English are shown in the blue arrow. Typically, you should place the negative word before the main verb.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_bl01">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p02">I was <em class="emphasis">barely</em> awake when I heard you come home.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p03">Kurt is <em class="emphasis">not</em> going with us.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p04">In casual English, it is common to form contractions, or shortened combined words, with the auxiliary or linking verb and the word <em class="emphasis">not</em>. Contractions are typically not acceptable in very formal writing but are becoming more and more common in certain academic and public contexts.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_bl02">
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p05">I haven’t heard that before.</p>
        <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p06">Jill isn’t my cousin.</p>
    </span>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p07">Using two negative words in the same sentence changes the meaning of the negative words to positive, thus supporting the common saying “Two negatives make a positive.” Think of it as being similar to multiplying two negative numbers and getting a positive number. Double negatives are often used in extremely casual talk but never in professional or academic settings.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Example</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p08"><strong class="emphasis bold">Correct:</strong> I didn’t hear anything.</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch21_s19_p09"><strong class="emphasis bold">Incorrect:</strong> I didn’t hear nothing. (The two negatives change to a positive, so the sentence technically means “I heard something.”)</p>
