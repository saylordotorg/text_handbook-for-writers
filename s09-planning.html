        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s00_p01">The composing habits of mind you developed in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a> through <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a> should be applied to a writing process that works for you. When you start planning a writing project, you will need to understand the relationships among the three corners and the three sides of the rhetorical triangle described in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>: voice, message, and audience, as well as attitude, reception, and tone. After you have these core elements of the triangle in place, you are ready to map out your writing.</p>

        <h3 class="title">Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_l01">
            <li>Recognize general topics that are too broad for a single writing assignment.</li>
            <li>Realize that you can and should massage a writing topic so that it interests you.</li>
            <li>Understand how to narrow a topic down to match your needs.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_p01">Life is simply too short not to write about topics that interest you. You don’t have to be an expert in a topic already, but you should be sufficiently interested in exploring it for a sustained period. Your readers will quickly pick up on your enthusiasm (or lack thereof) for a topic. Following up on personal interest can, at best, make a writing project fun, and at the very least, keep you (and your readers) from being miserable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_p02">Most college writing instructors will not dictate too narrow a topic area, in part because they don’t have any interest in being bored and in part because they believe that topic generation is an important piece of the student writer’s job. But let’s explore a worst-case scenario, just to show how you can make practically any topic your own. Let’s say you are given an assignment to explore the history of South Dakota within a ten-page essay. Clearly, you can’t cover the whole state in ten pages. Rather, you would think about—and maybe research a little bit—aspects of South Dakota that might be interesting to you and your readers. Let’s say that you are a motorcycle enthusiast, and you are interested in Sturgis, South Dakota. Or perhaps your great-great-grandmother was a Dakota Indian, and you are interested in the Dakota Indian tribe. Or maybe you are an artist and you are interested in the corn mosaics on the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota. The point is that, if you think about South Dakota enough, you can find some direction of personal interest.</p>

A method of moving from your general topic of interest to your final topic is to ask questions and let your answers guide you along. The following questions and answers show how this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-discussion</a><span class="glossdef">Asking and answering questions without involving another person.</span></span> could go.</p>

        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Answer:</strong> I bet there are people on both sides of the issue. On the other hand, a lot of people there make a great deal of money on the event.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #3:</strong> After over seventy years, has the event become such a part of the city that the bikes aren’t really seen as an invasion but rather more like a season that will naturally come?</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Answer:</strong> It probably has become a natural part of the city and the whole surrounding area. That would be a good topic: The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally as Part of the Identity of Sturgis and the Surrounding Area.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p01">After you have settled on a topic, you are ready to explore general ideas that you will include when you start writing. You can generate these ideas with whatever <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brainstorming</a><span class="glossdef">A technique for invention (generating ideas for writing); can be verbal or written, in collaboration or in isolation.</span></span> method works best for you, such as browsing the Internet to do an interconnected search from topic to topic, talking or texting with others, creating related visuals, asking yourself questions, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">freewriting</a><span class="glossdef">A method of idea generation usually involving a period of five to ten minutes of writing (or typing) without stopping, followed by another round of writing on a narrower passage of interest from the first round of freewriting.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mapping</a><span class="glossdef">A method of using shapes filled with text to create visual ideas for a writing process and to show how the ideas are related; also called clustering and branching, or making a web.</span></span>. In this section, we will explore these latter two options.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p02">Freewriting requires finding a quiet place to write without distraction. Most versions involve starting with a word or phrase (usually your topic) and writing (or typing) about it <em class="emphasis">without stopping</em> for five minutes. It’s helpful to set a timer for each round of freewriting. After the first five-minute period, you examine your text for any phrases or words that look interesting to you. Circle them (or if you are typing, highlight, italicize, bold, or underline them). In the second round, you freewrite for another five uninterrupted minutes on your choice of the most interesting word or phrase from your first freewrite. Sometimes even a third round can help you narrow the topic further. For each round of freewriting, you should be unconcerned about your writing’s grammar or mechanics, how it would look to an outside audience, or even whether it would make sense to anyone but you. Freewriting is all about idea generation and exploration.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p03">Mapping is a great visual means of gathering your ideas. Also called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">clustering and branching</a><span class="glossdef">A method of using shapes filled with text to create visual ideas for a writing process and to show how the ideas are related; also called clustering, mapping, or making a web.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">making a web</a><span class="glossdef">A method of using shapes filled with text to create visual ideas for a writing process and to show how the ideas are related; also called clustering and branching, or mapping.</span></span>, mapping lets you add as many ideas as you can think of and organize them as you go along. You have four general options for mapping.</p>
    <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_l02">
        <li>Use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concept-mapping software</a><span class="glossdef">Software used for mapping or clustering ideas.</span></span> such as Inspiration or SmartDraw.</li>
        <li>Use concept-mapping websites such as MindMeister (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindmeister.com/">http://www.mindmeister.com/</a>).</li>
        <li>Create your own circles and lines within a word processing program.</li>
        <li>Draw your map by hand.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p04">No one option is superior to another. You should choose the option that works best for you. Using whichever option you choose, the point is to start with your main topic and then think of related subtopics and, for each subtopic, to think of supporting details resulting in a visual that shows the relationships between the key points of your writing plan. Since mapping is actually a visual brainstorming process, you do not have to generate your ideas in an orderly fashion. When you think of an idea, you can add it wherever it fits across the map.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p05">In the concept-mapping software, you will be able to choose the level of the point you will add as well as the larger idea to which you want to attach each point. If you are creating your concept map structure yourself, make it clear to which level each addition belongs.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p06">Study <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch05_s02_f01">Figure 5.1 "Concept Map of Sturgis Motorcycle Rally"</a> for clarification on how the process works. This map was made in Microsoft Word by creating circles, squares, and lines and placing them by hand into position. You can use all circles or all squares or whatever shape(s) you would like. This map uses a combination of squares and circles to make the subtopics stand out clearly from the details. This map also uses color to differentiate between levels.</p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s02_p07">When the ideas stop flowing, put your map away and return to it later for another brainstorming session. Keep your freewrites and maps close at hand and feel free to add tidbits when they come to you. Get into the habit of keeping a writing pad and pen or pencil (or just your cell phone) next to your bed, so that you can jot down or text ideas as they come to you in the middle of the night. When you are comfortable that your map offers a good representation of the points you want to include in your paper, use it as a guide during the writing process.</p>

            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s03_p02">However, your real purposes for writing are really more complicated, interesting, and dynamic than this simple list. Purpose involves all three sides and all three corners of the rhetorical triangle: not only do you want to make your audience feel or think a certain way about your message, but you also want to explore and refine your own thoughts and feelings about that message, and furthermore, you want to establish a certain kind of relationship with your audience through the act of conveying your message to them.</p>

        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Audience</a><span class="glossdef">The reader(s) of an essay or a piece of communication.</span></span>: Sometimes your instructor will specify the audience for an essay assignment, but more often than not, this choice will be left up to you. If it’s your call, ask yourself, “Who would benefit the most from receiving this message?” Not asking that simple question, not choosing a specific audience for your essay, will be a missed opportunity to sharpen your skills as a communicator. By identifying your audience, you can conjecture how much your readers will know about your topic and thus gauge the level of information you should provide. You can determine what kind of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tone</a><span class="glossdef">The relationship between the voice (writer) and the audience (readers).</span></span> is best for your audience (e.g., formal or informal, humorous or serious). Based on what you know about your audience, you can even decide the form you want your writing to take (e.g., whether to write a descriptive or more persuasive essay). Knowing your audience will guide many of the other choices you make along the way.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Message</a><span class="glossdef">What a voice (writer) wants to convey about a topic to an audience (readers).</span></span>: Regardless of whether your topic is assigned to you or you come up with it on your own, you still have some room to develop your message. Be prepared to revise your message once you have fleshed out your own thinking about it (perhaps through asking and answering the Twenty Questions about Self, Text, and Context in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>) and sharpened your sense of audience and purpose thinking.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Voice</a><span class="glossdef">The writer of an essay or a piece of communication.</span></span>: Regardless of whether you’re writing in an academic or a nonacademic context, you draw from a range of voices to achieve a variety of purposes. Each of the purposes listed above has an appropriate voice. If you are writing an essay to fulfill a class assignment, with your instructor as your primary if not exclusive audience, then your voice has pretty much been established for you. In such an instance, you are a student writing in a traditional academic context, subject to the evaluation of your instructor as an expert authorized to judge your work. But even in this most restrictive case, you should still try to develop a distinctive voice based on what you hope to accomplish through your writing.</li>

But if you’re given some choice or flexibility about form, just as in the case of voice, audience, and message, you need to make the most of that responsibility. Regardless of who dictates form, you or your instructor, know what form your writing should take and make sure it suits the voice, audience, and message. Some common forms of writing include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_l02">

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p02">An outline is another way to visually see the relationships between ideas you are gathering. You can create an outline by hand or on a computer. If you create one by hand, leave a blank space so you can fit additional ideas in within different areas. Using a computer for your outline is preferable since you can easily add ideas and move ideas around.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p03">Start with your core idea as the beginning point of the outline. Then use roman numerals to add the subtopics followed by indented capital letters for the details. If you add finer details, you can use further-indented numbers for the next level and even-further-indented lowercase letters for a level after that. When using a computer, the preset tabs are most likely fine for the indenting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p04">The outline below relates to the map from the last section. It is simply another way to accomplish the same process of idea gathering. Notice that the writer here has made a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sentence outline</a><span class="glossdef">An outline with each element written out as a complete sentence.</span></span> by writing out each element in a complete sentence.
