    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s03_p01">After you have settled on a specific writing topic, it’s time to return to some of the basic principles of rhetoric introduced in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a> so that you can think through your real purposes for writing and explore the key details of your rhetorical situation. This section will show you how to use both the corners and the sides of the rhetorical triangle as tools for thinking, planning, and writing. Notice how these choices you make about purpose, message, audience, and voice are never made in isolation.</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s03_l02">
        <li>
            <p class="para"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Purpose</a><span class="glossdef">The sum total of what a writer intends to accomplish.</span></span>: You may think that purpose can be boiled down to one of these single verbs or phrases:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s03_l03">
                <li>To analyze</li>
                <li>To ask for support</li>
                <li>To call to action</li>
                <li>To clarify</li>
                <li>To convince</li>
                <li>To counter a previously stated opinion</li>
                <li>To describe</li>
                <li>To entertain</li>
                <li>To inform</li>
                <li>To make a request</li>
                <li>To make people think</li>
                <li>To persuade</li>
                <li>To share feelings</li>
                <li>To state an opinion</li>
                <li>To summarize</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s03_p02">However, your real purposes for writing are really more complicated, interesting, and dynamic than this simple list. Purpose involves all three sides and all three corners of the rhetorical triangle: not only do you want to make your audience feel or think a certain way about your message, but you also want to explore and refine your own thoughts and feelings about that message, and furthermore, you want to establish a certain kind of relationship with your audience through the act of conveying your message to them.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Audience</a><span class="glossdef">The reader(s) of an essay or a piece of communication.</span></span>: Sometimes your instructor will specify the audience for an essay assignment, but more often than not, this choice will be left up to you. If it’s your call, ask yourself, “Who would benefit the most from receiving this message?” Not asking that simple question, not choosing a specific audience for your essay, will be a missed opportunity to sharpen your skills as a communicator. By identifying your audience, you can conjecture how much your readers will know about your topic and thus gauge the level of information you should provide. You can determine what kind of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">tone</a><span class="glossdef">The relationship between the voice (writer) and the audience (readers).</span></span> is best for your audience (e.g., formal or informal, humorous or serious). Based on what you know about your audience, you can even decide the form you want your writing to take (e.g., whether to write a descriptive or more persuasive essay). Knowing your audience will guide many of the other choices you make along the way.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Message</a><span class="glossdef">What a voice (writer) wants to convey about a topic to an audience (readers).</span></span>: Regardless of whether your topic is assigned to you or you come up with it on your own, you still have some room to develop your message. Be prepared to revise your message once you have fleshed out your own thinking about it (perhaps through asking and answering the Twenty Questions about Self, Text, and Context in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>) and sharpened your sense of audience and purpose thinking.</li>
        <li>
<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Voice</a><span class="glossdef">The writer of an essay or a piece of communication.</span></span>: Regardless of whether you’re writing in an academic or a nonacademic context, you draw from a range of voices to achieve a variety of purposes. Each of the purposes listed above has an appropriate voice. If you are writing an essay to fulfill a class assignment, with your instructor as your primary if not exclusive audience, then your voice has pretty much been established for you. In such an instance, you are a student writing in a traditional academic context, subject to the evaluation of your instructor as an expert authorized to judge your work. But even in this most restrictive case, you should still try to develop a distinctive voice based on what you hope to accomplish through your writing.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s03_p03">Once you have identified your purposes and the corners of the rhetorical triangle, it’s time to do some preliminary thinking about the relationships between those corners—that is, the sides: voice and message (attitude), message and audience (reception), and voice and audience (tone). Finish the sentences below.</p>
