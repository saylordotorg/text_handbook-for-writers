        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s00_p01">You probably know someone who has said, “I’m a lousy writer, but it doesn’t matter since I don’t write for a living and I’m not an English teacher.” You might have even made such a comment yourself. In reality, good writing can help you from the moment you apply for a job throughout your time in the workforce. And regardless of whether you are writing in academic or professional settings, good writing involves an awareness of voice, audience, and message.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s01_p01">You might think that people living in the age of technology do not need to learn business letter skills. After all, in today’s professional world, e-mails have replaced business letters as the primary mode of communication. However, many formal situations are still best handled with business letters, whether they are sent on paper or as an attachment to an e-mail.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s01_p02">When writing a business letter, if you use business letterhead that includes the company address and other contact information, you do not need to incorporate that information within the letter. The most common format of business letters, the block format, uses one-inch margins with all content flush against the left margin, including the body paragraphs. Some less common forms do use indentation. Business letters include the following parts, as shown in this sample:</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s01_p03">When writing a business letter, keep these tips in mind:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s01_l02">
        <li>Do not use slang.</li>
        <li>Be professional.</li>
        <li>Be concise and to the point.</li>
        <li>Mention a personal connection, if you have one, briefly at the beginning of the letter to create a personalized introduction.</li>
        <li>Use the abbreviation “Enc.” or the word “Enclosed” prior to a list of papers that are included with the business letter.</li>
        <li>Proofread for grammar, punctuation, and spelling.</li>
        <li>Make sure that a letter attached to an e-mail is in a document format that your recipient also uses.</li>
        <li>Use a person’s name in the greeting whenever possible. If you have no way of acquiring a name, use “Dear Sir or Madam” or similar generic, but professional, wording.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_p01">As part of the process of applying for any job in any profession beyond the entry level, you are likely to have to produce two main written documents: a résumé and a cover letter or letter of application. Writing these documents well is often a key determiner in whether you get the job. To illustrate, we’ll follow a student, Joey Williams, through these two key professional writing challenges. Joey is a recent graduate of a master’s degree program in public relations who is seeking a position at a graphic design firm.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Creating Solid Résumés</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_p01">Common résumé formats vary with types of jobs and with the times, but regardless of the type of position you are seeking, your résumé should include some key features and some key information.</p>
        <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Key Résumé Features</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s01_p01">Effective résumés have the following features:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s01_l01">
                <li>They are meticulously edited (absolutely no errors).</li>
                <li>The subheadings stand out and are short enough to be read at a glance (one or two words).</li>
                <li>Ample white space is used.</li>
                <li>Lists are parallel.</li>
                <li>Bolding is used sparingly.</li>
                <li>One easy-to-read font is uniformly used throughout.</li>
                <li>The font is size 12.</li>
                <li>The résumé is available both in digital and hard-copy form.</li>
                <li>Formatting on a digital résumé holds when it is opened in others’ computers. This formatting should be straight type without tabbing, tables, italics, bolding, columns, or indenting. If it’s included as an attachment, it should be in a Microsoft Word file. A second option is to visually create the résumé as desired and then capture it in a PDF file.</li>
                <li>The résumé is confined to one page unless you are in a profession that requires additional pages or unless you are at a more advanced professional level that requires a more extensive résumé.</li>
                <li>The most recent information is presented first within each category.</li>
                <li>Standard résumé paper is used unless the specific profession calls for something different.</li>
                <li>Accomplishments are presented in nonwordy formats.</li>
                <li>Action verbs are used to describe accomplishments.</li>
                <li>Contact information is clearly visible at the top of the résumé.</li>
                <li>Key words that searchers in your professional field are likely to use are included in résumés that are posted online. (After your contact information, include a “key words” section or weave the keywords into your accomplishments.)</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Key Résumé Information</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p01">Every résumé should include the following information:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>professional name</li>
                <li>address</li>
                <li>phone number</li>
                <li>e-mail address</li>
                <li>work experience (i.e., places of employment)</li>
                <li>accomplishments at each place of employment</li>
                <li>education</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p02">These résumé components are optional:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>personal interests</li>
                <li>references</li>
                <li>dates of education and work experience</li>
                <li>address for personal website</li>
                <li>employment objective (a good strategy if you want to tailor your résumé for a certain job description)</li>
                <li>fax number</li>
                <li>awards and honors</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s01_s02_p03">To ensure that your résumé is both current and appropriate for the position, you should search online for similar sample résumés. You should also run your résumé past the career placement services at your college and any people you know who are working in your field of interest. Here’s Joey’s generic résumé:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Writing Targeted Cover Letters</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_p01">Along with sending a résumé when applying for a job, you will almost always want to send a cover letter. This suggestion holds true in both hard-copy and digital situations. A hard-copy cover letter should be formatted as a standard, typed business letter (for a sample, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch12#mccrimmon-ch12">Chapter 12 "Professional Writing"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch12_s01#mccrimmon-ch12_s01">Section 12.1 "Writing Business Letters"</a>). A digital cover letter should be either typed directly into a given window or copied and pasted into the window. If you copy and paste, check to make sure that the formatting holds.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_p02">When the job market is tight, just getting an interview is a major hurdle. Facing dozens and sometimes even hundreds of applicants, employers are looking for reasons to cut down their pool of potential interviewees. Don’t give them a reason <strong class="emphasis bold">not</strong> to interview you by writing a vaguely worded, overly general letter of application or résumé, especially when you can easily revise and tailor your approach to each position for which you are applying.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_p03">To <em class="emphasis">target</em> a cover letter means to write it specifically for an identified job. You can gather information to target your cover letter by looking carefully at the job description and by studying the company’s website. Let’s look at an example of an online job description that has caught Joey’s attention:</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s02_s02_s04_p01">Keep in mind that your cover letter is the first chance to present yourself and often the only chance. Besides being sure to include the most pertinent and valuable information you have to offer, be very careful that your letter is grammatically correct with no punctuation or spelling errors. Proofread it carefully yourself, and then, even if you think the letter is perfect, ask a trusted acquaintance to proofread it. Errors in this kind of high-stakes writing situation can be fatal to your chances of achieving your desired goal: getting your foot in the door professionally.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Using E-mail in the Workplace</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s04_s01_p01">E-mailing started small in the 1960s and became more widespread by the 1990s. Today the idea of going a day without e-mails is incomprehensible to many people, both professionally and personally. Even though most working people in the United States have both personal and work e-mail, workplace e-mail guidelines make the two quite different. Failing to follow these guidelines for workplace e-mails can have a range of ramifications from mild embarrassment to termination from your job. The following guidelines are general and most of them will apply in most workplaces. You are likely to find, however, that your workplace has its own guidelines that you will need to learn and follow.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s04_s01_p02">Here are some general workplace e-mail guidelines:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch12_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Make sure your writing has no grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors and no typos. Any e-mail, whether it is sent internally or externally, reflects not only on the person sending it but also on the organization employing that person.</li>
            <li>Use standard wording, spelling, punctuation, and capitalization. Do not use any of the abbreviated, casual text that is common in personal online communications.</li>
            <li>Use a subject line that targets the key point of the e-mail so that the subject line can be a helpful sorting or searching tool.</li>
            <li>Be concise.</li>
            <li>Be courteous.</li>
            <li>Use jokes sparingly since they are often misunderstood.</li>
            <li>Use short paragraphs. Large blocks of digital text are difficult to read.</li>
            <li>Type in upper- and lowercase letters. Writing in all capital letters is perceived as shouting and writing in all lowercase letters is difficult to read.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that electronic text is very easy to share with few or many. Don’t put anything in an e-mail that would be problematic if shared beyond your intended recipient.</li>
            <li>Most e-mail systems allow you to design and include a signature at the end of your e-mails, with the company name, your title, your e-mail address, and your phone number. Unless you are writing to a colleague with whom you have daily contact, plan to include your signature.</li>
            <li>When e-mailing a business acquaintance you do not know well, use a standard business letter greeting (“Dear Jack” or “Dear Mr. Wichel”) and closing (“Sincerely”). When you do know the person well, you can relax the greeting and closing a little if doing so would mesh with the culture of your company.</li>
            <li>Keep in mind that different computers and e-mail programs receive e-mail text differently. Do not rely on text features, such as bolding, italicizing, color, and underlining, to carry meaning.</li>
            <li>Clean up forwarded e-mails so that old e-mail components are not included unnecessarily or unintentionally.</li>
            <li>Take great care with your tone. A good way to check that your tone comes off accurately is to reread your e-mail aloud once you are finished writing it. If you sense that you are sending or replying to an e-mail out of anger or frustration, enforce an overnight cooling-off period before clicking the send button.</li>
            <li>If you make changes in your e-mail, reread the whole e-mail when you are finished to make sure you made any needed adjustments to accommodate the changes.</li>
            <li>Avoid using your work e-mail for personal messages, and especially avoid sending any messages or attachments that could be considered vulgar, offensive, or inappropriate. Keep in mind that all work e-mail might be monitored.</li>
            <li>Try not to send unusually large attachments that might clog the in-boxes of colleagues and coworkers, and keep your mailbox clean, so you don’t overtax the server space of your organization.</li>
