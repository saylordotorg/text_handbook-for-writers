            <li>Recognize general topics that are too broad for a single writing assignment.</li>
            <li>Realize that you can and should massage a writing topic so that it interests you.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_p01">Life is simply too short not to write about topics that interest you. You don’t have to be an expert in a topic already, but you should be sufficiently interested in exploring it for a sustained period. Your readers will quickly pick up on your enthusiasm (or lack thereof) for a topic. Following up on personal interest can, at best, make a writing project fun, and at the very least, keep you (and your readers) from being miserable.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_p02">Most college writing instructors will not dictate too narrow a topic area, in part because they don’t have any interest in being bored and in part because they believe that topic generation is an important piece of the student writer’s job. But let’s explore a worst-case scenario, just to show how you can make practically any topic your own. Let’s say you are given an assignment to explore the history of South Dakota within a ten-page essay. Clearly, you can’t cover the whole state in ten pages. Rather, you would think about—and maybe research a little bit—aspects of South Dakota that might be interesting to you and your readers. Let’s say that you are a motorcycle enthusiast, and you are interested in Sturgis, South Dakota. Or perhaps your great-great-grandmother was a Dakota Indian, and you are interested in the Dakota Indian tribe. Or maybe you are an artist and you are interested in the corn mosaics on the Corn Palace in Mitchell, South Dakota. The point is that, if you think about South Dakota enough, you can find some direction of personal interest.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_p07">Once you choose a direction of interest, such as the motorcycle rallies in Sturgis, you still have to narrow this secondary topic into a topic that you can cover in ten pages and that has an interesting point. A method of moving from your general topic of interest to your final topic is to ask questions and let your answers guide you along. The following questions and answers show how this <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">self-discussion</a><span class="glossdef">Asking and answering questions without involving another person.</span></span> could go.</p>
    <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s01_bl01">
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #1:</strong> How do the Sturgis Rallies connect to the history of South Dakota?</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Answer:</strong> The Sturgis Rallies have been going on for over seventy years, so they are part of the history of South Dakota.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #2:</strong> Over the years, how have the people of Sturgis felt about all those bikes invading their peaceful little city?</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Answer:</strong> I bet there are people on both sides of the issue. On the other hand, a lot of people there make a great deal of money on the event.</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Question #3:</strong> After over seventy years, has the event become such a part of the city that the bikes aren’t really seen as an invasion but rather more like a season that will naturally come?</p>
        <p class="para"><strong class="emphasis bold">Answer:</strong> It probably has become a natural part of the city and the whole surrounding area. That would be a good topic: The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally as Part of the Identity of Sturgis and the Surrounding Area.</p>

            <li>Record the thought processes you would go through to narrow the writing topic “Thomas Edison” to a topic of interest to you for a ten-page assignment. Include the transcript of your self-talk and self-questioning process.</li>
