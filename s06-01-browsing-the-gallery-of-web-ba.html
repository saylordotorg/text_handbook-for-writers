    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p01">Given that the focus of this chapter is on reading texts, the first section introduces a <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong>. Think of this alphabetical, annotated collection of websites as an alternative collection of readings to which you and your instructor can return at other points in the course. If your instructor is assigning a traditional, bound reader in addition to this handbook, these sites might be purely supplemental, but if not, they might serve as a storehouse from which to build a free do-it-yourself reader that could be central to the work you do in your composition course.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p02">Regardless of how you use these archives of texts, they’re meant to inspire you and your instructor to go on a scavenger hunt for other authoritative collections on the web. If your instructor is using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">course management system</a><span class="glossdef">A web-based learning environment that organizes the work of a course (e.g., Blackboard).</span></span> (like Blackboard) or a class-wide <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">wiki</a><span class="glossdef">An interactive, shared website featuring content that can be edited by many users.</span></span>, these sites could easily be lodged in a document library of external links, and you and your instructor could add sites as you discover (and annotate) them. (Or, of course, additional sites may be added to this very chapter by your instructor through <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>’s customization feature.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p03">This collection of web-based archives, even though it references several million texts, merely scratches the surface of the massive amount of material that’s freely available on the web. Remember, too, that your college library has likely invested heavily in searchable academic databases to which you have access as a student. Faculty members and librarians at your institution may already be at work creating in-house collections of readings drawn from these databases. (For more on such databases, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07#mccrimmon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Researching"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07_s02#mccrimmon-ch07_s02">Section 7.2 "Finding Print, Online, and Field Sources"</a> and consult your college’s library staff.)</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p04">Because these noncommercial, nonpartisan websites are sponsored by governmental and educational entities and organizations, they are not likely to disappear, but there are no guarantees. If links go dead, try your favorite search engine to see if the documents you’re seeking have been lodged elsewhere.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p05">The selection principle for this gallery is that the sites listed should be free of cost, free of commercial advertisements, free of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">partisanship</a><span class="glossdef">Taking an entirely one-sided point of view about a subject.</span></span> (though multiple sides are often presented), and free of copyright wherever possible. If you’re not bothered by ads, you’ll find a wealth of additional content, much of which will be very useful.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_p06">Finally, remember, just because these sites are free of charge and free of copyright doesn’t mean you don’t have to cite them appropriately if you end up using content from them in your writing. See <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch22#mccrimmon-ch22" xrefstyle="select: title">Chapter 22 "Appendix B: A Guide to Research and Documentation"</a> of this book for information on how to document electronic texts. You and your instructor also need to be aware of any copyright restrictions on duplicating and redistributing content on these sites. These restrictions will usually be found at the site itself, but when in doubt, consult your college library staff.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch02_s01_l02">
            <li>The web affords writing students and instructors countless opportunities to engage with texts in a variety of media and genres.</li>
            <li>The vast majority of web-based texts are available free of charge. A significant minority of publicly and privately funded sites are also free of advertisement and often free of copyright.</li>
            <li>Your status as a college student also puts you in a great position to make use of any online library databases to which your college subscribes.</li>
            <li>Even though web texts are easily accessible, they still need to be documented appropriately when used as part of a writing project.</li>

            <li>Individually or in a group, go on a scavenger hunt for another web-based archive of texts that could be useful to your composition class as part of a no-cost alternative to a pricey print collection of readings. Try to meet the same criteria this handbook uses: the collection of texts should be free of charge, free of copyright restriction, free of partisanship, and free of advertising (except for sponsorship information in the case of nonprofit organizations). Write up an annotated entry on what you find, following the same format used in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong>.</li>
            <li>Individually or in a group, get to know the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong> in more detail. Find and critically analyze five to ten individual texts from one archive. Your critical analysis should include answers to at least five of the questions in the list of questions about <strong class="emphasis bold">speaker</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">audience</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">statement</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">relevance</strong> in the next section or at least five of the <strong class="emphasis bold">Twenty Questions about Self, Text, and Context</strong> in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>. Be prepared to present your findings in a class discussion, on the class discussion board, or on a class-wide wiki.</li>
            <li>Find two texts from two different archives in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong> that explore a similar theme or topic in different ways, either from two different ideological perspectives or through two different genres or media. Write an essay that compares and contrasts the two different texts.</li>
