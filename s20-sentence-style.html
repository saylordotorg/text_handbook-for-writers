        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Sentence Style Matters</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s00_p01">Imagine a world where all music was in a single monotone, all paintings were the same shade of green, and all dancing consisted of one slow dance step. Writing with only one kind of sentence style would fit nicely into that world. In truth, music, art, and dance gain much beauty and interest from wide variation. You, as a writer, also have the option to vary your sentence style strategically. This chapter will help you vary sentence lengths and styles and choose when to write in active and passive voice. You will also learn how to use subordination, coordination, and parallelism to achieve emphasis and balance, how to control for sexist and offensive language, and how to manage the mood of the verbs in your writing.</p>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_l01">
            <li>Understand the value of varied sentence lengths within a body of text.</li>

            <li>Recognize different sentence styles.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_p01">Text written with only one type of sentence is boring for readers. To make your texts more interesting, you should use sentences of varying lengths, with different openings and endings, and with a variety of structures.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Featuring Short Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p01">Short sentences, when not overused, can be used to emphasize an idea and catch a reader’s attention. Notice how the ideas expressed through the following short sentences grab your attention more than the same ideas do when embedded in longer sentences.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ideas separated into shorter sentences:</strong> My mother wants me to spend next weekend with her and my two aunts. They all talk nonstop. I am sure I would be nothing more than a fly on the wall while they talk about all the family members. I am simply not going!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Ideas embedded in longer sentences:</strong> My mother wants me to spend next weekend with her and my two aunts who all talk nonstop. I am sure I would be nothing more than a fly on the wall while they talk about all the family members, so I am simply not going!</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s01_p04">But you need to be careful to choose your short sentences strategically so that they carry emphasis without making your writing appear unsophisticated. A third option might be to use one longer sentence and break up the other one into two shorter sentences.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Combining Short Sentences</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_p01">Since an abundance of short sentences will give a simplistic appearance to your writing, you don’t want to use an excessive number of them close together. You can combine short sentences as a means of explaining an idea or a connection between two ideas. When you combine two complete sentences, you have to choose to either subordinate one of the ideas to the other or coordinate the two ideas by giving them equal weight. Your choice should always reflect the intended emphasis and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">causality</a><span class="glossdef">The relationship between the cause of an action and its effect (e.g., “The food spoiled because I left the freezer door open last night”).</span></span> of the two initial sentences.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Example</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Two short sentences:</strong> My television is broken. It is Karen’s fault.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s02_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Sentence combination that maintains intended emphasis and causality:</strong> Because of Karen, my television is broken.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Incorporating Sentences of Varying Lengths</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p01">Text of varying lengths is easier to read than text where the sentences are all about the same length. A whole page of extremely long sentences is overwhelming. Try reading a high-level academic paper on a scientific topic. The sentences are often long and involved, which results in difficult reading. A whole page of very short sentences, on the other hand, is choppy and seems unsophisticated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p02">Consider the following text that begins the first chapter of Mark Twain’s <em class="emphasis">A Tramp Abroad</em>. Twain begins with a long sentence (thirty-three words), follows with a medium-length sentence (seventeen words), and closes with two short sentences (six and five words, respectively). This mix of sentence lengths creates text that flows smoothly and is easy to read.</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_bl01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s03_p04">Now read a different version of the same paragraph. Notice how the short sentences sound choppy and juvenile.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s01_s04_p01">Like making all your sentences the same length, starting all your sentences in the same format—say, with “the” or “there”—could result in seriously boring text. Even if you vary your openings slightly but still follow the basic subject–verb–object format every time, you’re missing an opportunity to make your sentences more interesting.

        </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_p01">Sydney J. Harris, a Chicago journalist, said, “We have not passed that subtle line between childhood and adulthood until we move from the passive voice to the active voice—that is, until we have stopped saying, ‘It got lost,’ and say, ‘I lost it.’” Besides being a rite of passage in human development, routinely using active voice also marks growth in your writing ability.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_p02">As a college writer, you need to know when and how to use both active and passive voice. Although <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">active voice</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence in which the subject is doing the action (e.g., “James ate the donut”).</span></span> is the standard preferred writing style, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">passive voice</a><span class="glossdef">A sentence in which the subject is receiving the action (e.g., “The donut was eaten by James”).</span></span> is acceptable, and even preferred, in certain situations. However, as a general rule, passive voice tends to be awkward, vague, and wordy.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Recognizing Active and Passive Voice</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p01">Lack of awareness or understanding of passive voice may cause you to use it regularly. Once you fully grasp how it differs from active voice, passive voice will begin to stand out. You will then recognize it when you use it as well as when others use it.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p02">To use active voice, you should make the noun that performs the action the subject of the sentence and pair it directly with an action verb.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p03">Read these two sentences:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Matt Damon left</strong> Harvard in the late 1980s to start his acting career.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p05">Matt Damon’s acting <strong class="emphasis bold">career was started</strong> in the late 1980s when he left Harvard.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p06">In the first sentence, “left” is an action verb that is paired with the subject, “Matt Damon.” If you ask yourself “Who or what left?” the answer is “Matt Damon.” Neither of the other two nouns in the sentence—”Harvard” and “career”—left anything.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s01_p07">Now look at the second sentence. The action verb is “started.” If you ask yourself “Who or what started something?” the answer is again “Matt Damon.” But in this sentence, “career” has been placed in the subject position, not “Matt Damon.” When the doer of the action is not in the subject position, the sentence is in passive voice. In passive voice constructions, the doer of the action usually follows the word “by” as the indirect object of a prepositional phrase, and the action verb is typically partnered with a version of the verb “to be.”</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s04_p01">Once you completely understand the difference between active and passive voice, writing in active voice becomes easy. All you have to do is to make sure you always clearly say who or what did what. And if you notice you are using forms of the verb “to be” with your action verb, look closely at the reason. If you are writing in progressive tense (“Carrie is walking to my house”) or perfect progressive tense (“Melissa will have been married for four years by then”), you will need to use such helping verbs, even in active voice.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s05_l01">
            <li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Controlling Emphasis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p01">You likely use subordination and coordination automatically. For example, if you say that something happened (e.g., Dale broke his leg while sledding) because of something else (e.g., he broke his leg when he sledded into a tree), you can use separate sentences, or you can use subordination within one sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p02">Ideas presented in two sentences: Dale broke his leg while sledding this weekend. His leg broke when the sled hit a tree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p03">Ideas presented in one sentence using subordination: This weekend, Dale broke his leg when his sled hit a tree. [Dale broke his leg is the main idea. The fact that it happened when the sled hit a tree is the subordinated idea.]</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p04">A natural way to use coordination is, for example, to discuss two things you plan to do on vacation. You can present the two ideas in separate sentences or in one sentence using coordination to signal equal emphases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p05">Ideas presented in two sentences: I’m planning to see the Statue of Liberty while I’m in New York. I’m also going to go to a Broadway play.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Subordination Pitfalls</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p01">You will want to avoid two common subordination mistakes: placing main ideas in subordinate clauses or phrases and placing too many subordinate ideas in one sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p02">Here’s an example of a sentence that subordinates the main idea:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>LoDo, a charming neighborhood featuring great art galleries, restaurants, cafés, and shops, is located in the Lower Downtown District of Denver.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p03">The problem here is that main idea is embedded in a subordinate clause. Instead of focusing on the distinctive features of the LoDo neighborhood, the sentence makes it appear as if the main idea is the neighborhood’s location in Denver. Here’s a revision:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l02">
            <li>LoDo, located in the Lower Downtown District of Denver, is a charming neighborhood featuring great art galleries, restaurants, cafés, and shops.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p04">A sentence with too many subordinated ideas is confusing and difficult to read.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p05">Here’s an example:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l03">
            <li>Television executives, who make the decisions about which shows to pull and which to extend, need to consider more than their individual opinions so that they do not pull another <em class="emphasis">Star Trek</em> mess-up where they don’t recognize a great show when they see it, while balancing the need to maintain a schedule that appeals to a broad audience, considering that new types of shows don’t yet have a broad following.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p06">And here’s a possible revision:</p>

                <li>Subordination refers to ideas in a sentence that are of less importance than the main idea. Subordinated ideas are typically connected to the rest of the sentence with a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun.</li>
                <li>Coordination refers to two or more ideas of equal weight in a single sentence. Coordinated ideas are usually joined to each other with coordinating conjunctions or correlative conjunctions.</li>
                <li>You can create emphasis using subordination and coordination within longer sentences.</li>

It’s one of those features of writing that’s a matter of grammar, style, rhetoric, and content. Used well, it can enhance your readers’ (and even your own) understanding and appreciation of a topic. The most famous line from John F. Kennedy’s Inaugural Address provides another example (a specific kind of reversal of phrasing known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">antimetabole</a><span class="glossdef">A specific kind of parallelism involving the repetition and reversal of elements of a phrase.</span></span>): “Ask not what your country can do for you.

    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p02">Here are a couple of examples of sentences in need of parallelism.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Example 1</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">While it was raining, I had to run into the grocery store, the dry cleaners, and stop at the bookstore.</strong></p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p04">This sentence is not parallel because it includes three equally weighted ideas but presents two of them with action verbs and one without. By simply adding words such as “duck into” to the middle item, the sentence becomes parallel: <em class="emphasis bolditalic">While it was raining, I had to run into the grocery store, duck into the dry cleaners, and stop at the bookstore.</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p05">You could also correct this sentence by removing “stop at” from the third idea: <em class="emphasis bolditalic">While it was raining, I had to run into the grocery store, the dry cleaners, and the book store.</em></p>
    </div>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_n03">
        <h3 class="title">Example 2</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p06"><strong class="emphasis bold">The test was long and requiring skills we hadn’t learned.</strong></p>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s04_p09">Parallelism is most often an issue with paired ideas and items in a series as shown in the preceding two examples. A key idea to keep in mind is that you need to use common wording with both items, such as common articles (e.g., <em class="emphasis">the</em>, <em class="emphasis">a</em>, <em class="emphasis">an</em>) and common prepositions (e.g., <em class="emphasis">by</em>, <em class="emphasis">for</em>, <em class="emphasis">of</em>, <em class="emphasis">on</em>, <em class="emphasis">to</em>).

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s05_p01">The rights of women have changed dramatically over the past few decades. Slowly, written English has started to reflect those changes. No longer is it considered appropriate to refer to a “female engineer” or a “male nurse.” It is also unacceptable to refer generically to a doctor as “him,” a teacher as “her,” or a politician as “him.” Such usage is considered to be <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sexist language</a><span class="glossdef">Words that suggest that a given situation or role is attributable to members of only one sex (e.g., mailman).</span></span>. You can use acceptable <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nonsexist language</a><span class="glossdef">Words that suggest that a given situation or role is attributable to members of both sexes (e.g., mail carrier).</span></span> by using passive voice (see the example in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch16_s02#mccrimmon-ch16_s02_s05">Section 16.2.5 "Using Passive Voice"</a>), using plural formats (see the examples in <a class="xref" href="#mccrimmon-ch16_s05_s01">Section 16.5.1 "Using Plural Format"</a>), eliminating pronouns, switching to direct address, and choosing nonsexist terms whenever possible. An option of last resort is to use “his or her,” “his/her,” “her or his,” or “her/his” or even to alternate “his” and “her” throughout a text, though this path is stylistically awkward and usually unnecessary given the other options available to you.</p>

            <li>Use currently accepted terminology when referencing groups of people. If you are writing about a group of people and you are unsure of the proper terminology, research the most recent usage patterns before you write.</li>

For example, say “a person who uses a wheelchair” instead of “a wheelchair-bound person.”</li>
            <li>Do not use profanity or vulgar words of any kind. When in doubt, don’t use the term, or if you must use it as part of a quotation, make clear that you’re quoting it.</li>
            <li>Avoid <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">stereotyping</a><span class="glossdef">Attributing common traits to all members of a group.</span></span> (ascribing positive or negative attributes to people based on groups to which they belong).</li>
