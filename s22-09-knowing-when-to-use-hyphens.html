But just to be clear, let’s review them briefly here.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch18_s09_s02_p02">Use hyphens to write all two-word numbers between twenty-one and ninety-nine. Also, use hyphens when writing those numbers within larger numbers. Hyphenate a fraction you are expressing as a single quantity, regardless of whether you are using it as a noun or as an adjective.</p>
