            <li>Understand connotations of words and choose words with connotations that work best for your purposes.</li>
            <li>Incorporate specific and concrete words as well as figurative language into your writing.</li>

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_p01">By using precise wording, you can most accurately relay your thoughts. Some strategies that can help you put your thoughts into words include focusing on denotations and connotations, balancing specific and concrete words with occasionally figurative language, and being on guard against clichés and misused words.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Focusing on Both Denotations and Connotations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01_p01">Consider that the words “laid-back” and “lackadaisical” both mean “unhurried and slow-moving.” If someone said you were a “laid-back” student, you would likely be just fine with that comment, but if someone said you were a “lackadaisical” student, you might not like the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">connotation</a><span class="glossdef">The emotional sense of a word; the various ways in which it can be received by a listener or reader.</span></span>. Nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs all have both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">denotations</a><span class="glossdef">The definition of a word.</span></span> and connotations. The denotation is the definition of a word. The connotation is the emotional sense of a word. For example, look at these three words:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>excited</li>
            <li>agitated</li>
            <li>flustered</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s01_p02">The three words all mean to be stirred emotionally. In fact, you might see one of the words as a definition of another one of them. And you would definitely see the three words in a common list in a thesaurus. So the denotations for the three words are about the same. But the connotations are quite different. The word “excited” often has a positive, fun underlying meaning; “agitated” carries a sense of being upset; and “flustered” suggests a person is somewhat out of control. When you are choosing a word to use, you should first think of a word based on its denotation. Then you should consider if the connotation fits your intent. For more on using a dictionary or thesaurus to enhance and add precision to your word choices, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch17_s04#mccrimmon-ch17_s04">Section 17.4 "Using the Dictionary and Thesaurus Effectively"</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Choosing Specific and Concrete Words</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s02_p01">You will always give clearer information if you write with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">specific words</a><span class="glossdef">A detail within a category (e.g., cat within the category animals).</span></span> rather than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">general words</a><span class="glossdef">A category (e.g., animals).</span></span>.

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s02_p04">Another way to make your writing clearer and more interesting is to use <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">concrete words</a><span class="glossdef">A word that evokes a physical sense such as taste, smell, hearing, sight, or touch.</span></span> rather than <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">abstract words</a><span class="glossdef">A word that does not have physical properties.</span></span>. Abstract words do not have physical properties. But concrete words evoke senses of taste, smell, hearing, sight, and touch. For example, you could say, “My shoe feels odd.” This statement does not give a sense of why your shoe feels odd since odd is an abstract word that doesn’t suggest any physical characteristics. Or you could say, “My shoe feels wet.” This statement gives you a sense of how your shoe feels to the touch. It also gives a sense of how your shoe might look as well as how it might smell.

Also, if your spellchecker identifies a misspelled word, don’t automatically accept the suggested replacement word. Make an informed decision about each word you use.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch17_s03_s05_l01">
                <li>Words have both denotations and connotations, and you need to focus on both of these meanings when you choose your words.</li>
                <li>Specific words, such as “fork” or “spoon” instead of “silverware,” and concrete words, such as a “piercing siren” instead of a “loud sound,” create more interesting writing.</li>
                <li>Figurative language, including alliteration, analogies, hyperbole, idioms metaphors, onomatopoeia, personification, and similes, helps make text more interesting and meaningful.</li>
                <li>Both clichés and improperly used words detract from your writing. Reword clichés using straightforward language. Eliminate improperly used words by researching words about which you are not sure.</li>
