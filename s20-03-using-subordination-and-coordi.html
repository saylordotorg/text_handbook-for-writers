    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Subordination</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s01_p01">Subordination allows you to convey differences in importance between details within a sentence. You can use the technique within a single sentence or to combine two or more smaller sentences. You should always present the most important idea in an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">independent clause</a><span class="glossdef">A part of a sentence that includes both a noun and a verb and could form a stand-alone sentence.</span></span> and use dependent clauses and phrases to present the less important ideas. Start each <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dependent clause</a><span class="glossdef">A part of a sentence that presents an idea that could not stand alone as a sentence.</span></span> with a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">subordinating conjunction</a><span class="glossdef">A word that introduces less important ideas in a sentence (e.g., after, because, if).</span></span> (e.g., <em class="emphasis">after</em>, <em class="emphasis">because</em>, <em class="emphasis">by the time</em>, <em class="emphasis">even though</em>, <em class="emphasis">if</em>, <em class="emphasis">just in case</em>, <em class="emphasis">now that</em>, <em class="emphasis">once</em>, <em class="emphasis">only if</em>, <em class="emphasis">since</em>, <em class="emphasis">though</em>, <em class="emphasis">unless</em>, <em class="emphasis">until</em>, <em class="emphasis">when</em>, <em class="emphasis">whether</em>, <em class="emphasis">while</em>) or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative pronoun</a><span class="glossdef">A pronoun that is singular or plural based on the pronoun’s antecedent (e.g., who, that).</span></span> (e.g., <em class="emphasis">that</em>, <em class="emphasis">what</em>, <em class="emphasis">whatever</em>, <em class="emphasis">which</em>, <em class="emphasis">whichever</em>, <em class="emphasis">who</em>, <em class="emphasis">whoever</em>, <em class="emphasis">whom</em>, <em class="emphasis">whomever</em>, <em class="emphasis">whose</em>). These starters signal the reader that the idea is subordinate. Here’s a sentence that uses a relative pronoun to convey subordination:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>I will come to your house or meet you at the gym, <strong class="emphasis bold">whichever</strong> works best for you.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s01_p02">The core idea is that I will either come to your house or meet you at the gym. The fact that you’ll choose whichever option works best for you is subordinate, set apart with the relative pronoun “whichever.”</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s01_p03">In the next example, two smaller sentences are combined using the subordinating conjunction “because”:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s01_l02">
            <li>Smaller sentence 1: The number of students who live at home and take online college classes has risen in the past ten years.</li>
            <li>Smaller sentence 2: The rise has been due to increased marketing of university online programs.</li>
            <li>Larger sentence using subordination (version 1): The number of students living at home and taking online college classes has risen in the past ten years <strong class="emphasis bold">because</strong> of increased marketing of university online programs.</li>
            <li>Larger sentence using subordination (version 2): <strong class="emphasis bold">Because</strong> of increased marketing of university online programs, the number of students living at home and taking online courses has risen in the past ten years.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Coordination</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s02_p01">Some sentences have two or more equal ideas. You can use coordination to show a common level of importance among parts of a sentence, such as subjects, verbs, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">objects</a><span class="glossdef">A noun, noun phrase, or noun substitute that receives the action of the verb (direct object: “He ate the <em class="emphasis">apple</em>”) or a noun or pronoun that indicates to or for whom the action of a verb is performed (indirect object: “He gave the apple to <em class="emphasis">me</em>”).</span></span>.</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Examples</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s02_p02"><strong class="emphasis bold">Subject example:</strong> Both <span class="token">green beans</span> and <span class="token">asparagus</span> are great with grilled fish.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s02_p03"><strong class="emphasis bold">Verb example:</strong> We neither <span class="token">talked</span> nor <span class="token">laughed</span> during the whole two hours.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s02_p04"><strong class="emphasis bold">Object example:</strong> Machine embroidery combines <span class="token">the beauty of high-quality stitching</span> and <span class="token">the expediency of modern technology</span>.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s02_p05">The underlined ideas within each sentence carry equal weight within their individual sentences. As examples of coordination, they can be connected with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">coordinating conjunctions</a><span class="glossdef">A word that joins like-weighted ideas in a sentence (e.g., and, but, or).</span></span> (<em class="emphasis">and</em>, <em class="emphasis">but</em>, <em class="emphasis">for</em>, <em class="emphasis">nor</em>, <em class="emphasis">or</em>, <em class="emphasis">so</em>, <em class="emphasis">yet</em>) or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">correlative conjunctions</a><span class="glossdef">A set of words or phrases that joins ideas of equal weight (e.g., either…or, not only…but also).</span></span> (<em class="emphasis">both…and</em>, <em class="emphasis">either…or</em>, <em class="emphasis">just as…so</em>, <em class="emphasis">neither…nor</em>, <em class="emphasis">not…but</em>, <em class="emphasis">not only…but also</em>, <em class="emphasis">whether…or</em>).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Controlling Emphasis</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p01">You likely use subordination and coordination automatically. For example, if you say that something happened (e.g., Dale broke his leg while sledding) because of something else (e.g., he broke his leg when he sledded into a tree), you can use separate sentences, or you can use subordination within one sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p02">Ideas presented in two sentences: Dale broke his leg while sledding this weekend. His leg broke when the sled hit a tree.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p03">Ideas presented in one sentence using subordination: This weekend, Dale broke his leg when his sled hit a tree. [Dale broke his leg is the main idea. The fact that it happened when the sled hit a tree is the subordinated idea.]</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p04">A natural way to use coordination is, for example, to discuss two things you plan to do on vacation. You can present the two ideas in separate sentences or in one sentence using coordination to signal equal emphases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p05">Ideas presented in two sentences: I’m planning to see the Statue of Liberty while I’m in New York. I’m also going to go to a Broadway play.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s03_p06">Ideas presented in one sentence using coordination: While I’m in New York, I am planning to see the Statue of Liberty and go to a Broadway play.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Subordination Pitfalls</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p01">You will want to avoid two common subordination mistakes: placing main ideas in subordinate clauses or phrases and placing too many subordinate ideas in one sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p02">Here’s an example of a sentence that subordinates the main idea:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>LoDo, a charming neighborhood featuring great art galleries, restaurants, cafés, and shops, is located in the Lower Downtown District of Denver.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p03">The problem here is that main idea is embedded in a subordinate clause. Instead of focusing on the distinctive features of the LoDo neighborhood, the sentence makes it appear as if the main idea is the neighborhood’s location in Denver. Here’s a revision:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l02">
            <li>LoDo, located in the Lower Downtown District of Denver, is a charming neighborhood featuring great art galleries, restaurants, cafés, and shops.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p04">A sentence with too many subordinated ideas is confusing and difficult to read.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p05">Here’s an example:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l03">
            <li>Television executives, who make the decisions about which shows to pull and which to extend, need to consider more than their individual opinions so that they do not pull another <em class="emphasis">Star Trek</em> mess-up where they don’t recognize a great show when they see it, while balancing the need to maintain a schedule that appeals to a broad audience, considering that new types of shows don’t yet have a broad following.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_p06">And here’s a possible revision:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l04">
            <li>Television executives need to consider more than their individual opinions when they decide which shows to pull and which to extend. Many years ago, some of these very executives decided that <em class="emphasis">Star Trek</em> should be canceled, clearly demonstrating they do not always know which shows will become great. Television executives should also balance the need to maintain a schedule that appeals to a broad audience with an appreciation for new types of shows that don’t yet have a broad following.</li>
        </ul>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch16_s03_s04_l05">
                <li>Subordination refers to ideas in a sentence that are of less importance than the main idea. Subordinated ideas are typically connected to the rest of the sentence with a subordinating conjunction or a relative pronoun.</li>
                <li>Coordination refers to two or more ideas of equal weight in a single sentence. Coordinated ideas are usually joined to each other with coordinating conjunctions or correlative conjunctions.</li>
                <li>You can create emphasis using subordination and coordination within longer sentences.</li>
                <li>Problems with subordination include placing main ideas in subordinated clauses and phrases and including too many subordinated ideas in one sentence.</li>
