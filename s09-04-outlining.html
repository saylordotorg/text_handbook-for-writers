            <li>Recognize that an outline allows you to visually see the relationships between ideas for a writing project.</li>
            <li>Understand that you can create an outline by hand but that using a computer provides useful conveniences.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p01">Your instructor may make decisions about the form your essay will take, dictating whether you are supposed to write in a particular genre. But if you’re given some choice or flexibility about form, just as in the case of voice, audience, and message, you need to make the most of that responsibility. Regardless of who dictates form, you or your instructor, know what form your writing should take and make sure it suits the voice, audience, and message. Some common forms of writing include the following:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_l02">
        <li>Argument</li>
        <li>Book review</li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Case study</a><span class="glossdef">An accounting of a particular person, group, or situation over a period of time.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Comparative analysis</a><span class="glossdef">A comparison of the attributes of two or more ideas, situations, people, or things.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Critique</a><span class="glossdef">A written evaluation of an idea, situation, person, text, or thing.</span></span></li>
        <li>Informative essay or report</li>
        <li>Lab report</li>
        <li>Opinion essay</li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Personal narrative</a><span class="glossdef">An account of a personal situation.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Persuasive essay</a><span class="glossdef">A piece intended to sway others’ opinions.</span></span></li>
        <li><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Proposal</a><span class="glossdef">A detailed plan for consideration by others.</span></span></li>
        <li>Research report</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p02">An outline is another way to visually see the relationships between ideas you are gathering. You can create an outline by hand or on a computer. If you create one by hand, leave a blank space so you can fit additional ideas in within different areas. Using a computer for your outline is preferable since you can easily add ideas and move ideas around.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p03">Start with your core idea as the beginning point of the outline. Then use roman numerals to add the subtopics followed by indented capital letters for the details. If you add finer details, you can use further-indented numbers for the next level and even-further-indented lowercase letters for a level after that. When using a computer, the preset tabs are most likely fine for the indenting.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p04">The outline below relates to the map from the last section. It is simply another way to accomplish the same process of idea gathering. Notice that the writer here has made a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">sentence outline</a><span class="glossdef">An outline with each element written out as a complete sentence.</span></span> by writing out each element in a complete sentence. This strategy will help this writer move more easily from outline to essay draft.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_p05">As with the mapping process, once you have included all the ideas you have, take a break and return to your outline later. If, in the meantime, a thought comes to you, take a minute to add it. When you are satisfied with your outline, use it to guide your writing process. However, keep in mind that your outline is only a tool you are using, and you will vary from it when you have other ideas along the way.</p>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch05_s04_l08">
            <li>Outlining uses roman numerals, numbers, letters, and indenting to visually show how ideas are related.</li>

            <li>
                <p class="para">Within an outline, the numbering/lettering order is as follows:</p>
