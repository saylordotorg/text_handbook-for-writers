        <h2 class="title editable block">The Rhetorical Triangle</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s01_p01">The principles Aristotle laid out in his <em class="emphasis">Rhetoric</em> nearly 2,500 years ago still form the foundation of much of our contemporary practice of argument. The rhetorical situation Aristotle argued was present in any piece of communication is often illustrated with a triangle to suggest the interdependent relationships among its three elements: the <strong class="emphasis bold">voice</strong> (the speaker or writer), the <strong class="emphasis bold">audience</strong> (the intended listeners or readers), and the <strong class="emphasis bold">message</strong> (the text being conveyed).</p>
        <div class="informalfigure large block">

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s01_p02">If each corner of the triangle is represented by one of the three elements of the rhetorical situation, then each side of the triangle depicts a particular relationship between two elements:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tone.</strong> The connection established between the <strong class="emphasis bold">voice</strong> and the <strong class="emphasis bold">audience</strong>.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Attitude.</strong> The orientation of the <strong class="emphasis bold">voice</strong> toward the <strong class="emphasis bold">message</strong> it wants to convey.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rhetorical Appeals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p01">In this section, we’ll focus on how the rhetorical triangle can be used in service of argumentation, especially through the balanced use of ethical, logical, and emotional appeals: ethos, logos, and pathos, respectively. In the preceding figure, you’ll note that each appeal has been placed next to the corner of the triangle with which it is most closely associated:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ethos.</strong> Appeals to the credibility, reputation, and trustworthiness of the speaker or writer (most closely associated with the <strong class="emphasis bold">voice</strong>).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pathos.</strong> Appeals to the emotions and cultural beliefs of the listeners or readers (most closely associated with the <strong class="emphasis bold">audience</strong>).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Logos.</strong> Appeals to reason, logic, and facts in the argument (most closely associated with the <strong class="emphasis bold">message</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Each of these appeals relies on a certain type of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">evidence</a><span class="glossdef">The backing for a claim in an argument.</span></span>: ethical, emotional, or logical. Based on your audience and purpose, you have to decide what combination of techniques will work best as you present your case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p03">When using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">logical appeal</a><span class="glossdef">A rhetorical strategy that relies on the strength of its own logic, reasoning, and evidence.</span></span>, make sure to use sound inductive and deductive reasoning to speak to the reader’s common sense. Specifically avoid using emotional comments or pictures if you think your audience will see their use as manipulative or inflammatory. For example, in an essay proposing that participating in high school athletics helps students develop into more successful students, you could show graphs comparing the grades of athletes and nonathletes, as well as high school graduation rates and post–high school education enrollment. These statistics would support your points in a logical way and would probably work well with a school board that is considering cutting a sports program.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p04">The goal of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotional appeal</a><span class="glossdef">A rhetorical strategy based on inciting emotions in the audience.</span></span> is to garner sympathy, develop anger, instill pride, inspire happiness, or trigger other emotions. When you choose this method, your goal is for your audience to react emotionally regardless of what they might think logically. In some situations, invoking an emotional appeal is a reasonable choice. For example, if you were trying to convince your audience that a certain drug is dangerous to take, you might choose to show a harrowing image of a person who has had a bad reaction to the drug. In this case, the image draws an emotional appeal and helps convince the audience that the drug is dangerous. Unfortunately, emotional appeals are also often used unethically to sway opinions without solid reasoning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p05">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethical appeal</a><span class="glossdef">A rhetorical strategy based on calling attention to the credibility of the speaker or writer.</span></span> relies on the credibility of the author. For example, a college professor who places a college logo on a website gains some immediate credibility from being associated with the college. An advertisement for tennis shoes using a well-known athlete gains some credibility. You might create an ethical appeal in an essay on solving a campus problem by noting that you are serving in student government. Ethical appeals can add an important component to your argument, but keep in mind that ethical appeals are only as strong as the credibility of the association being made.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p06">Whether your argument relies primarily on logos, pathos, ethos, or a combination of these appeals, plan to make your case with your entire arsenal of facts, statistics, examples, anecdotes, illustrations, figurative language, quotations, expert opinions, discountable opposing views, and common ground with the audience. Carefully choosing these supporting details will control the tone of your paper as well as the success of your argument.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Logical, Emotional, and Ethical Fallacies</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s03_p01">Rhetorical appeals have power. They can be used to motivate or to manipulate. When they are used irresponsibly, they lead to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fallacies</a><span class="glossdef">Misleading statements and constructions used in argumentation.</span></span>. Fallacies are, at best, unintentional reasoning errors, and at worst, they are deliberate attempts to deceive. Fallacies are commonly used in advertising and politics, but they are not acceptable in academic arguments. The following are some examples of three kinds of fallacies that abuse the power of logical, emotional, or ethical appeals (logos, pathos, or ethos).</p>

Getting into the habit of reading academic, commercial, and political rhetoric carefully will enable you to see through manipulative, fallacious uses of verbal, written, and visual language. Being on guard for these fallacies will make you a more proficient college student, a smarter consumer, and a more careful voter, citizen, and member of your community.</p>

For good examples from advertising, politics, history, and government, try the Ad Council, the Avalon Project, From Revolution to Reconstruction, The Living Room Candidate, or the C-SPAN Video Library. For example, The Living Room Candidate site allows you to survey television ads from any presidential campaign since 1952. You could study five ads for each of the major candidates and subject the ads to a thorough review of their use of rhetorical techniques. Cite how and where each ad uses each of the three rhetorical appeals, and determine whether you think each ad uses the appeals manipulatively or legitimately. In this case, subject your political biases and preconceptions to a review as well. Is your view of one candidate’s advertising more charitable than the other for any subjective reason?</li>
                <li>Find five recent print, television, or web-based advertisements and subject them to a thorough review of their use of rhetorical techniques. Determine whether you think each advertisement uses rhetorical appeals responsibly and effectively or misuses the appeals through fallacies. Identify the appeals employed in either case.</li>

                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s03_p03">Europe is too thickly planted with kingdoms to be long at peace, and whenever a war breaks out between England and any foreign power, the trade of America goes to ruin, because of her connection with Britain. The next war may not turn out like the Past, and should it not, the advocates for reconciliation now will be wishing for separation then, because, neutrality in that case, would be a safer convoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ’TIS TIME TO PART. Even the distance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America, is a strong and natural proof, that the authority of the one, over the other, was never the design of Heaven.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s03_p04">American colonists faced a dialectic between continuing to be ruled by Great Britain or declaring independence. Arguments in favor of independence (such as Paine’s) are quite familiar to students of American history; the other side of the dialectic, which did not prevail, will likely be less so. In the following passage, Charles Inglis, in his 1776 pamphlet, <em class="emphasis">The True Interest of America Impartially Stated</em>, makes a case for ending the rebellion and reconciling with Great Britain. At one point in the passage, Inglis quotes Paine directly (calling him “this author”) as part of his rebuttal. As in the preceding exercise, read the passage and discuss its use of rhetorical appeals. Again, which of the three appeals (logos, pathos, or ethos) predominates, and why? For a link to the entire Inglis document, search for Inglis in From Revolution to Reconstruction in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02_s01#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong>, or click on <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/D/1776-1800/libertydebate/inglis.htm">http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/D/1776-1800/libertydebate/inglis.htm</a> to go to the link directly:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s03_p05">By a reconciliation with Britain, a period would be put to the present calamitous war, by which so many lives have been lost, and so many more must be lost, if it continues. This alone is an advantage devoutly to be wished for. This author says, “The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, Tis time to part.” I think they cry just the reverse. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries—It is time to be reconciled; it is time to lay aside those animosities which have pushed on Britons to shed the blood of Britons; it is high time that those who are connected by the endearing ties of religion, kindred and country, should resume their former friendship, and be united in the bond of mutual affection, as their interests are inseparably united.</p>
