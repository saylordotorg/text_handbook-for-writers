            <li>Locate subjects and verbs in sentences.</li>
            <li>Determine whether subjects and verbs agree in number and person.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p01">By the time you reach college, you probably have a fairly well-developed sense of whether a sentence sounds right. In fact, that’s one of the main reasons why you should get into the habit of reading your drafts aloud before you submit them for peer or instructor review. Or better yet, ask a friend to read your draft back to you. You’ll be surprised how many careless errors you catch just from hearing them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p02">One key aspect that can make a sentence sound incorrect is if the subject and verb do not agree. In properly written sentences, the subjects and verbs must agree in number and person. Agreeing in number means that a plural subject is matched up with the plural form of the verb. Although the plural of a noun often ends in -<em class="emphasis">s</em>, it is the singular of a verb that usually ends in -<em class="emphasis">s</em>.</p>
    <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_n02">
        <h3 class="title">Examples</h3>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p03">The <em class="emphasis bolditalic">rabbit hops</em> all around the cage. (singular subject and verb)</p>
        <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p04">The <em class="emphasis bolditalic">rabbits hop</em> all around the cage. (plural subject and verb)</p>
    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch15_s03_p05">Agreeing in person means, for example, a third-person noun must be matched with the proper third-person verb. This chart shows first, second, and third person for a few present-tense verbs. As you can see, most of the verbs are the same in all columns except for the third-person singular. The verb “to be” at the bottom also varies in the first-person singular column. So to match subjects and verbs by person, you could choose, for example, to say “I am,” but not “I are.”</p>
