        <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_l01">
            <li>Appreciate the fact that rhetoric is value-neutral and ever present.</li>
            <li>Understand the relationship between dialectic and rhetoric.</li>
            <li>Learn about the differences between low-stakes private writing and high-stakes public writing.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_p01">The word <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetoric</a><span class="glossdef">The manner in which language is used by a writer to persuade or motivate a specific audience.</span></span>, like <em class="emphasis">critical</em> (from <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>), has taken on a negative connotation in recent years. Politicians are fond of using the (ironically rhetorical) technique of boasting that they will “not indulge in rhetoric,” or accusing their opponents of “being rhetorical,” as if it were possible to communicate at all without using rhetoric. Rhetoric is simply a value-neutral term for communication that has a purpose. It can be used in the service of good or evil, or something in between, but it is always used. Communicating publicly without using rhetoric is like driving across town without a car.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_p02">Just as you used writing to think in the first three chapters, when you write publicly in this chapter and beyond, you shouldn’t stop thinking. Sometimes public and academic writing is presented as a fixed, sterile transcript or translation of already completed thoughts. But the more faithfully you depict your thinking process in front of your readers, the more engaged your audience will be, and the more they will want to share in your journey.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Dialectic and Rhetoric</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>, we explored how disciplines navigate between binary oppositions to sustain dialogue, debate, and the possibility of new discoveries. The classical term for sustaining a productive tension between binary oppositions is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dialectic</a><span class="glossdef">A tension between two binary oppositions that produces insight and knowledge in an area of study.</span></span>, from the Greek word meaning “dialogue.” We have been suggesting that you could use dialectic in your academic pursuits as a way of understanding concepts and perhaps even producing new insights.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s01_p02">A good working knowledge of the methods and strategies of rhetoric will put you in position to apply, translate, and convey publicly the insights you generate through dialectic thinking. In classical terms, dialectic and rhetoric were considered to be complementary counterparts. If you merely think dialectically without eventually using public rhetoric, your insights will be isolated and irrelevant. On the other hand, if you use only rhetoric without first going through some rigorously dialectical thinking, your communication will be undisciplined, shallow, overly partial and subjective, and lacking in perspective. An educated, ethical person needs to use both dialectic and rhetoric in order to engage fully with the world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Moving from Low-Stakes to High-Stakes Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Let’s bring these ideas down to earth with an example of how a semiprivate journal entry was partially but not completely transformed into a piece of public communication in an academic setting. In the first couple of weeks of the semester, Zach, a first-year college writing student, wrote the following entry in his electronic writing journal (a space that had been set up for “semiprivate” communication between students and their instructor, with an understanding that the instructor would neither grade the entries nor comment on them unless invited to do so):</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p02">Two days ago, when my mother got laid off, I was notified that my paycheck was now, not only the primary and bread-winning income, but the ONLY income. This is really putting stress onto me and because of this means two of everything, for example two car payments, twice the insurance, the entire phone bill, and the entire rent amount.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p03">Later in the term, when students were invited to post suggestions for the next year’s entering class of students on a class-wide wiki, Zach decided to go public with his story (<strong class="emphasis bold">embedded</strong> in his new, now public post).</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Strategies for Success in Community College</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p04">Many incoming community college students enter into their freshman year with the part-time job that they acquired in their senior year of high school. For me, entering into the new college environment with a full-time job has been a bit of a hassle as well as being quite stressful. When I started my freshman year, my job paid my share of the rent and phone bill as well as my car payment and insurance payment.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p05">Early in the semester, <strong class="emphasis bold">when my mother got laid off, I was notified that my paycheck was now, not only the primary and bread-winning income, but the ONLY income. This is really putting stress onto me and because of this means two of everything, for example two car payments, twice the insurance, the entire phone bill, and the entire rent amount.</strong></p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p06">When you start your college careers, you must pace yourself when you take your first semester of classes. It is best to put your job on the back burner. You do not want to start following me down the bumpy road of life. The path I have chosen has been extremely stressful. In choosing this path, I am close to not only losing my job but I am also dangerously close to failing out of some of my classes. A full-time job as well as being a full-time student is NOT recommended, especially for a first-time student.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p07">Going public with his personal difficulty and addressing an audience (other than himself and his professor) has prompted Zach to begin considering in some detail the dialectic tensions many of his fellow students face between school and work, school and family, and family and work. This deepening of his thinking from pure narrative (“<em class="emphasis">x</em> happened, then <em class="emphasis">y</em> happened”) into analysis (“this is why <em class="emphasis">x</em> and <em class="emphasis">y</em> happened and how they relate to each other”) is an example of how rhetorical responsibility can raise the stakes and the quality of a piece of writing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p08">However, Zach hasn’t yet moved fully into a rhetorical mode with this post because he is still working through the various dialectics he has raised. He has actually gone public too early in the process, before he has come up with some reasonably meaningful and complete ideas to convey to his newly recruited audience. He has closed with an incontrovertibly true statement: “A full-time job as well as being a full-time student is NOT recommended, especially for a first-time student.” But he hasn’t yet worked out an alternative to that arrangement that also meets the needs of his family. The wiki post is, more realistically, step two of a multistep process. Now that he has an audience in mind and a clear sense of his dilemma, he needs to explore a realistic and sustainable solution to this problem on a wider scale.</p>

            <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_l02">
                <li>Uncover a dialectic tension in a piece of your journal writing. Lay out a plan for how you could move from dialectic to rhetoric. How would you explore this dialectic further and ultimately present it rhetorically to an audience of your choosing? If appropriate, execute your plan.</li>
                <li>Review a piece of “finished” text, either an essay you’ve already produced for an audience or grade or a published piece by another writer. Identify a dialectic tension in the piece that was oversimplified or dismissed in the interest of “going public” prematurely. Use your findings to lay out a plan to move from rhetoric back to dialectic and then move back to a more balanced, effective, meaningful use of rhetoric.</li>
                <li>
                    <p class="para">Revise the following semiprivate journal entry about juggling work, family, and school into a public wiki post for an audience of entering college students. Use the following steps:</p>

                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p09">Sometimes going to school full time and trying to make money is difficult and to do it I have to juggle my responsibilities and manage my time appropriately. A big problem I have is when I am working I am often too exhausted to spend the necessary amount of concentration I need to on my school work. I work for my parents remodeling my house which includes a lot of physical labor such as painting, putting down flooring, refinishing cabinets, and so forth. These things drain a lot of energy out of me and make it hard to study and focus at night. I have been doing a mediocre job keeping up with school and work but would like to be able to make improvements in both without being so tired.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p10">To do this I started alternating between doing school work in the afternoons and working in the mornings. Instead of during a bunch of physical labor early in the day and tiring my self out by night time when it was time to do my homework I switched the two. I started my day out by making a list of all the homework I needed to do that day and then did half of it. After I completed half of my homework I would do the work I was suppose to around my house until everything that needed to be done that day was done. After I finished my work I took a break and ate. I left myself a couple hours to relax or socialize before I had to finish the rest of my homework. This schedule left me with a lot more energy at night and less homework to do which let me put more attention and focus into actually understanding the homework and completing the assignments. Alternating between different things depending on my energy level and time of day has been a helpful strategy for me to overcome my major time-management problem for this week.</p>
