<span class="title-prefix">Chapter 4</span> Joining the Conversation</h1>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_p01">Thus far we’ve established why it’s important to slow down your thinking and avoid rushing to judgment about topics. We’ve demonstrated how a close, careful, critical reading of texts can produce greater insights. We’ve explored the interplay among academic disciplines and shown how using various disciplinary lenses can lead us to see the world in different ways. We haven’t yet turned these private thinking exercises into public writing. It’s time to go public and join the conversation.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_p02">Because they have presented critical thinking strategies, the first three chapters have only occasionally touched on the stakes involved in actually presenting your ideas publicly. In this final chapter, you will learn what’s involved in using rhetoric to write for a specific audience and purpose.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_p01">The word <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">rhetoric</a><span class="glossdef">The manner in which language is used by a writer to persuade or motivate a specific audience.</span></span>, like <em class="emphasis">critical</em> (from <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>), has taken on a negative connotation in recent years. Politicians are fond of using the (ironically rhetorical) technique of boasting that they will “not indulge in rhetoric,” or accusing their opponents of “being rhetorical,” as if it were possible to communicate at all without using rhetoric. Rhetoric is simply a value-neutral term for communication that has a purpose. It can be used in the service of good or evil, or something in between, but it is always used. Communicating publicly without using rhetoric is like driving across town without a car.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_p02">Just as you used writing to think in the first three chapters, when you write publicly in this chapter and beyond, you shouldn’t stop thinking. Sometimes public and academic writing is presented as a fixed, sterile transcript or translation of already completed thoughts. But the more faithfully you depict your thinking process in front of your readers, the more engaged your audience will be, and the more they will want to share in your journey.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Dialectic and Rhetoric</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s01_p01">In <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>, we explored how disciplines navigate between binary oppositions to sustain dialogue, debate, and the possibility of new discoveries. The classical term for sustaining a productive tension between binary oppositions is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">dialectic</a><span class="glossdef">A tension between two binary oppositions that produces insight and knowledge in an area of study.</span></span>, from the Greek word meaning “dialogue.” We have been suggesting that you could use dialectic in your academic pursuits as a way of understanding concepts and perhaps even producing new insights.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s01_p02">A good working knowledge of the methods and strategies of rhetoric will put you in position to apply, translate, and convey publicly the insights you generate through dialectic thinking. In classical terms, dialectic and rhetoric were considered to be complementary counterparts. If you merely think dialectically without eventually using public rhetoric, your insights will be isolated and irrelevant. On the other hand, if you use only rhetoric without first going through some rigorously dialectical thinking, your communication will be undisciplined, shallow, overly partial and subjective, and lacking in perspective. An educated, ethical person needs to use both dialectic and rhetoric in order to engage fully with the world.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Moving from Low-Stakes to High-Stakes Writing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p01">Let’s bring these ideas down to earth with an example of how a semiprivate journal entry was partially but not completely transformed into a piece of public communication in an academic setting. In the first couple of weeks of the semester, Zach, a first-year college writing student, wrote the following entry in his electronic writing journal (a space that had been set up for “semiprivate” communication between students and their instructor, with an understanding that the instructor would neither grade the entries nor comment on them unless invited to do so):</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p02">Two days ago, when my mother got laid off, I was notified that my paycheck was now, not only the primary and bread-winning income, but the ONLY income. This is really putting stress onto me and because of this means two of everything, for example two car payments, twice the insurance, the entire phone bill, and the entire rent amount.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p03">Later in the term, when students were invited to post suggestions for the next year’s entering class of students on a class-wide wiki, Zach decided to go public with his story (<strong class="emphasis bold">embedded</strong> in his new, now public post).</p>
        <div class="callout editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_n01">
            <h3 class="title">Strategies for Success in Community College</h3>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p04">Many incoming community college students enter into their freshman year with the part-time job that they acquired in their senior year of high school. For me, entering into the new college environment with a full-time job has been a bit of a hassle as well as being quite stressful. When I started my freshman year, my job paid my share of the rent and phone bill as well as my car payment and insurance payment.</p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p05">Early in the semester, <strong class="emphasis bold">when my mother got laid off, I was notified that my paycheck was now, not only the primary and bread-winning income, but the ONLY income. This is really putting stress onto me and because of this means two of everything, for example two car payments, twice the insurance, the entire phone bill, and the entire rent amount.</strong></p>
            <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p06">When you start your college careers, you must pace yourself when you take your first semester of classes. It is best to put your job on the back burner. You do not want to start following me down the bumpy road of life. The path I have chosen has been extremely stressful. In choosing this path, I am close to not only losing my job but I am also dangerously close to failing out of some of my classes. A full-time job as well as being a full-time student is NOT recommended, especially for a first-time student.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p07">Going public with his personal difficulty and addressing an audience (other than himself and his professor) has prompted Zach to begin considering in some detail the dialectic tensions many of his fellow students face between school and work, school and family, and family and work. This deepening of his thinking from pure narrative (“<em class="emphasis">x</em> happened, then <em class="emphasis">y</em> happened”) into analysis (“this is why <em class="emphasis">x</em> and <em class="emphasis">y</em> happened and how they relate to each other”) is an example of how rhetorical responsibility can raise the stakes and the quality of a piece of writing.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p08">However, Zach hasn’t yet moved fully into a rhetorical mode with this post because he is still working through the various dialectics he has raised. He has actually gone public too early in the process, before he has come up with some reasonably meaningful and complete ideas to convey to his newly recruited audience. He has closed with an incontrovertibly true statement: “A full-time job as well as being a full-time student is NOT recommended, especially for a first-time student.” But he hasn’t yet worked out an alternative to that arrangement that also meets the needs of his family. The wiki post is, more realistically, step two of a multistep process. Now that he has an audience in mind and a clear sense of his dilemma, he needs to explore a realistic and sustainable solution to this problem on a wider scale.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p09">Sometimes going to school full time and trying to make money is difficult and to do it I have to juggle my responsibilities and manage my time appropriately. A big problem I have is when I am working I am often too exhausted to spend the necessary amount of concentration I need to on my school work. I work for my parents remodeling my house which includes a lot of physical labor such as painting, putting down flooring, refinishing cabinets, and so forth. These things drain a lot of energy out of me and make it hard to study and focus at night. I have been doing a mediocre job keeping up with school and work but would like to be able to make improvements in both without being so tired.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s01_s02_p10">To do this I started alternating between doing school work in the afternoons and working in the mornings. Instead of during a bunch of physical labor early in the day and tiring my self out by night time when it was time to do my homework I switched the two. I started my day out by making a list of all the homework I needed to do that day and then did half of it. After I completed half of my homework I would do the work I was suppose to around my house until everything that needed to be done that day was done. After I finished my work I took a break and ate. I left myself a couple hours to relax or socialize before I had to finish the rest of my homework. This schedule left me with a lot more energy at night and less homework to do which let me put more attention and focus into actually understanding the homework and completing the assignments. Alternating between different things depending on my energy level and time of day has been a helpful strategy for me to overcome my major time-management problem for this week.</p>

The rhetorical situation Aristotle argued was present in any piece of communication is often illustrated with a triangle to suggest the interdependent relationships among its three elements: the <strong class="emphasis bold">voice</strong> (the speaker or writer), the <strong class="emphasis bold">audience</strong> (the intended listeners or readers), and the <strong class="emphasis bold">message</strong> (the text being conveyed).</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Rhetorical Appeals</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p01">In this section, we’ll focus on how the rhetorical triangle can be used in service of argumentation, especially through the balanced use of ethical, logical, and emotional appeals: ethos, logos, and pathos, respectively. In the preceding figure, you’ll note that each appeal has been placed next to the corner of the triangle with which it is most closely associated:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ethos.</strong> Appeals to the credibility, reputation, and trustworthiness of the speaker or writer (most closely associated with the <strong class="emphasis bold">voice</strong>).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pathos.</strong> Appeals to the emotions and cultural beliefs of the listeners or readers (most closely associated with the <strong class="emphasis bold">audience</strong>).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Logos.</strong> Appeals to reason, logic, and facts in the argument (most closely associated with the <strong class="emphasis bold">message</strong>).</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Each of these appeals relies on a certain type of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">evidence</a><span class="glossdef">The backing for a claim in an argument.</span></span>: ethical, emotional, or logical. Based on your audience and purpose, you have to decide what combination of techniques will work best as you present your case.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p03">When using a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">logical appeal</a><span class="glossdef">A rhetorical strategy that relies on the strength of its own logic, reasoning, and evidence.</span></span>, make sure to use sound inductive and deductive reasoning to speak to the reader’s common sense. Specifically avoid using emotional comments or pictures if you think your audience will see their use as manipulative or inflammatory. For example, in an essay proposing that participating in high school athletics helps students develop into more successful students, you could show graphs comparing the grades of athletes and nonathletes, as well as high school graduation rates and post–high school education enrollment. These statistics would support your points in a logical way and would probably work well with a school board that is considering cutting a sports program.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p04">The goal of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotional appeal</a><span class="glossdef">A rhetorical strategy based on inciting emotions in the audience.</span></span> is to garner sympathy, develop anger, instill pride, inspire happiness, or trigger other emotions. When you choose this method, your goal is for your audience to react emotionally regardless of what they might think logically. In some situations, invoking an emotional appeal is a reasonable choice. For example, if you were trying to convince your audience that a certain drug is dangerous to take, you might choose to show a harrowing image of a person who has had a bad reaction to the drug. In this case, the image draws an emotional appeal and helps convince the audience that the drug is dangerous. Unfortunately, emotional appeals are also often used unethically to sway opinions without solid reasoning.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p05">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ethical appeal</a><span class="glossdef">A rhetorical strategy based on calling attention to the credibility of the speaker or writer.</span></span> relies on the credibility of the author. For example, a college professor who places a college logo on a website gains some immediate credibility from being associated with the college. An advertisement for tennis shoes using a well-known athlete gains some credibility. You might create an ethical appeal in an essay on solving a campus problem by noting that you are serving in student government. Ethical appeals can add an important component to your argument, but keep in mind that ethical appeals are only as strong as the credibility of the association being made.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s02_p06">Whether your argument relies primarily on logos, pathos, ethos, or a combination of these appeals, plan to make your case with your entire arsenal of facts, statistics, examples, anecdotes, illustrations, figurative language, quotations, expert opinions, discountable opposing views, and common ground with the audience. Carefully choosing these supporting details will control the tone of your paper as well as the success of your argument.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s03_p01">Rhetorical appeals have power. They can be used to motivate or to manipulate. When they are used irresponsibly, they lead to <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fallacies</a><span class="glossdef">Misleading statements and constructions used in argumentation.</span></span>. Fallacies are, at best, unintentional reasoning errors, and at worst, they are deliberate attempts to deceive.

For good examples from advertising, politics, history, and government, try the Ad Council, the Avalon Project, From Revolution to Reconstruction, The Living Room Candidate, or the C-SPAN Video Library. For example, The Living Room Candidate site allows you to survey television ads from any presidential campaign since 1952. You could study five ads for each of the major candidates and subject the ads to a thorough review of their use of rhetorical techniques. Cite how and where each ad uses each of the three rhetorical appeals, and determine whether you think each ad uses the appeals manipulatively or legitimately. In this case, subject your political biases and preconceptions to a review as well. Is your view of one candidate’s advertising more charitable than the other for any subjective reason?</li>
                <li>Find five recent print, television, or web-based advertisements and subject them to a thorough review of their use of rhetorical techniques. Determine whether you think each advertisement uses rhetorical appeals responsibly and effectively or misuses the appeals through fallacies. Identify the appeals employed in either case.</li>

The next war may not turn out like the Past, and should it not, the advocates for reconciliation now will be wishing for separation then, because, neutrality in that case, would be a safer convoy than a man of war. Every thing that is right or natural pleads for separation. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, ’TIS TIME TO PART. Even the distance at which the Almighty hath placed England and America, is a strong and natural proof, that the authority of the one, over the other, was never the design of Heaven.</p>

                    <p class="para" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s02_s03_p04">American colonists faced a dialectic between continuing to be ruled by Great Britain or declaring independence. Arguments in favor of independence (such as Paine’s) are quite familiar to students of American history; the other side of the dialectic, which did not prevail, will likely be less so. In the following passage, Charles Inglis, in his 1776 pamphlet, <em class="emphasis">The True Interest of America Impartially Stated</em>, makes a case for ending the rebellion and reconciling with Great Britain. At one point in the passage, Inglis quotes Paine directly (calling him “this author”) as part of his rebuttal. As in the preceding exercise, read the passage and discuss its use of rhetorical appeals. Again, which of the three appeals (logos, pathos, or ethos) predominates, and why? For a link to the entire Inglis document, search for Inglis in From Revolution to Reconstruction in the <strong class="emphasis bold"><a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02_s01#mccrimmon-ch02_s01_n02">Note 2.5 "Gallery of Web-Based Texts"</a></strong>, or click on <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/D/1776-1800/libertydebate/inglis.htm">http://www.let.rug.nl/usa/D/1776-1800/libertydebate/inglis.htm</a> to go to the link directly:</p>

This alone is an advantage devoutly to be wished for. This author says, “The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries, Tis time to part.” I think they cry just the reverse. The blood of the slain, the weeping voice of nature cries—It is time to be reconciled; it is time to lay aside those animosities which have pushed on Britons to shed the blood of Britons; it is high time that those who are connected by the endearing ties of religion, kindred and country, should resume their former friendship, and be united in the bond of mutual affection, as their interests are inseparably united.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Induction and Deduction</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01_p01">Traditionally, arguments are classified as either <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inductive</a><span class="glossdef">A reasoning method that draws a general conclusion from a particular set of facts.</span></span> or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">deductive</a><span class="glossdef">A reasoning method based on drawing a single conclusion from multiple pieces of evidence.</span></span>. Inductive arguments consider a number of results and form a generalization based on those results. In other words, say you sat outside a classroom building and tallied the number of students wearing jeans and the number wearing something other than jeans. If after one hour, you had tallied 360 students wearing jeans and 32 wearing other clothes, you could use inductive reasoning to make the generalization that most students at your college wear jeans to class. Here’s another example. While waiting for your little sister to come out of the high school, you saw 14 girls wearing high heels. So you assume that high heels are standard wear for today’s high school girls.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01_p02">Deductive arguments begin with a general principle, which is referred to as a major premise. Then a related premise is applied to the major premise and a conclusion is formed. The three statements together form a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">syllogism</a><span class="glossdef">A deductive conclusion drawn from a major premise and a minor premise.</span></span>. Here are some examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>Major premise: Leather purses last a long time.</li>
            <li>Minor premise: I have a leather purse.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: My purse will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Major premise: Tara watches a lot of television.</li>
            <li>Minor premise: Tara is a very good student.</li>
            <li>Conclusion: A teenager can be a good student even if he or she watches a lot of television.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01_p03">Although these simple inductive and deductive arguments are fairly clean and easy to follow, they can be flawed because of their rigidity.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01_p04">Let’s revisit the “college students wear jeans” argument. What if you happened to be counting jeans wearers on a day that has been declared Denim Appreciation Day? Or conversely, what if you had taken the sample on the hottest day of the year in the middle of the summer session? Although it might be true that most students in your sample <strong class="emphasis bold">on that day</strong> wore jeans to class, the argument as it stands is not yet strong enough to support the statement.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s01_p05">Now consider the purse argument. The argument is not strong since a variety of possible exceptions are obvious. First, not all leather purses last a long time since the leather could be strong, but the workmanship could be shoddy (challenge to major premise). Second, the quality of the leather in your particular purse could be such that it would not hold up to heavy use (challenge to minor premise). Third, a possible exception is that the argument does not take into account how long I have had my purse: even though it is made of leather, its lifespan could be about over. Since very few issues are completely straightforward, it is often easy to imagine exceptions to simplistic arguments. For this reason, somewhat complex argument forms have been developed to address more complicated issues that require some flexibility.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Types of Argumentation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s02_p01">Three common types of argumentation are <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">classical</a><span class="glossdef">A type of argument that relies on the presentation of a thesis, use of rhetorical appeals, and refutation of opposing views.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Toulminian</a><span class="glossdef">Based on the work of Stephen Toulmin, a type of argument concerned with the establishment of claims, backed by warrants and supported with evidence.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Rogerian</a><span class="glossdef">Based on the work of Carl Rogers, a type of argument concerned with finding common ground with one’s adversary and ultimately reaching a consensus or compromise.</span></span>. You can choose which type to use based on the nature of your argument, the opinions of your audience, and the relationship between your argument and your audience.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s02_p03">Toulminian argumentation (named for its creator, Stephen Toulmin) includes three components: a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">claim</a><span class="glossdef">A statement of an arguable position backed up by evidence.</span></span>, stated grounds to support the claim, and unstated assumptions called warrants. Here’s an example:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s02_l06">
            <li>Claim: All homeowners can benefit from double-pane windows.</li>
            <li>Grounds: Double-pane windows are much more energy efficient than single-pane windows. Also, double-pane windows block distracting outside noise.</li>
            <li>Warrant: Double-pane windows keep houses cooler in summer and warmer in winter, and they qualify for the tax break for energy-efficient home improvements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s02_p04">The purest version of Rogerian argumentation (named for its creator, Carl Rogers) actually aims for true compromise between two positions. It can be particularly appropriate when the dialectic you are addressing remains truly unresolved. However, the Rogerian method has been put into service as a motivational technique, as in this example:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s02_l07">
            <li>Core argument: First-semester college students should be required to attend three writing sessions in the college writing center.</li>
            <li>Common ground: Many first-semester college students struggle with college-level work and the overall transition from high school to college.</li>
            <li>Link between common ground and core argument: We want our students to have every chance to succeed, and students who attend at least three writing sessions in the university writing lab are 90 percent more likely to succeed in college.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s02_p05">Rogerian argumentation can also be an effective standard debating technique when you are arguing for a specific point of view. Begin by stating the opposing view to capture the attention of audience members who hold that position and then show how it shares common ground with your side of the point. Your goal is to persuade your audience to come to accept your point by the time they read to the end of your argument. Applying this variation to the preceding example might mean leading off with your audience’s greatest misgivings about attending the writing center, by opening with something like “First-semester college students are so busy that they should not be asked to do anything they do not really need to do.”</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Analytical and Problem-Solving Argumentation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s03_p01">Arguments of any kind are likely to either take a position about an issue or present a solution to a problem. Don’t be surprised, though, if you end up doing both. If your goal is to analyze a text or a body of data and justify your interpretation with evidence, you are writing an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">analytical argument</a><span class="glossdef">An interpretation of a text or body of data backed up with evidence.</span></span>. Examples include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Evaluative reviews (of restaurants, films, political candidates, etc.)</li>
            <li>Interpretations of texts (a short story, poem, painting, piece of music, etc.)</li>
            <li>Analyses of the causes and effects of events (9/11, the Civil War, unemployment, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s03_p02"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Problem-solving argumentation</a><span class="glossdef">A supported claim that a particular method of solving a problem is most effective.</span></span> is not only the most complicated but also the most important type of all. It involves several thresholds of proof. First, you have to convince readers that a problem exists. Second, you have to give a convincing description of the problem. Third, because problems often have more than one solution, you have to convince readers that your solution is the most feasible and effective. Think about the different opinions people might hold about the severity, causes, and possible solutions to these sample problems:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s03_l02">
            <li>Global warming</li>
            <li>Nonrenewable energy consumption</li>
            <li>The federal budget deficit</li>
            <li>Homelessness</li>
            <li>Rates of personal saving</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s03_p03">Argumentation often requires a combination of analytical and problem-solving approaches. Whether the assignment requires you to analyze, solve a problem, or both, your goal is to present your facts or solution confidently, clearly, and completely. Despite the common root word, when writing an argument, you need to guard against taking a too argumentative tone. You need to support your statements with evidence but do so without being unduly abrasive. Good argumentation allows us to disagree without being disagreeable.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Research and Revision in Argumentation</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s04_p01">Your college professors are not interested in having you do in-depth research for its own sake, just to prove that you know how to incorporate a certain number of sources and document them appropriately. It is assumed that extensive research is a core feature of a strong essay. In college-level writing, research is not meant merely to provide additional support for an already fixed idea you have about the topic, or to set up a “straw man” for you to knock down with ease. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to make your research fit your existing argument. Research conducted in good faith will almost certainly lead you to refine your ideas about your topic, leading to multiple revisions of your work. It might cause you even to change your topic entirely. (For more on research and revision in argumentation, see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch07#mccrimmon-ch07">Chapter 7 "Researching"</a> and <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch08#mccrimmon-ch08">Chapter 8 "Revising"</a>.)</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s03_s04_p02">Revision is part of the design of higher education. If you embrace the “writing to think” and “writing to learn” philosophy and adopt the “composing habits of mind” outlined in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch01#mccrimmon-ch01">Chapter 1 "Writing to Think and Writing to Learn"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch02#mccrimmon-ch02">Chapter 2 "Becoming a Critical Reader"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch03#mccrimmon-ch03">Chapter 3 "Thinking through the Disciplines"</a>, and <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>, with each draft, you will likely rethink your positions, do additional research, and make other general changes. As you conduct additional research between drafts, you are likely to find new information that will lead you to revise your core argument. Let your research drive your work, and keep in mind that your argument will remain in flux until your final draft. In the end, every final draft you produce should feel like a small piece of a vast and never ending conversation.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch04_s04_p01">The habit of thinking rhetorically starts with being comfortable enough with the rhetorical triangle to see it in practically every form of communication you produce and consume—not only those you encounter in academic settings but also those you encounter in everyday life. In several other chapters, you will make use of the elements (corners) and relationships (sides) of the rhetorical triangle, as well as the appeals associated with it. In <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05#mccrimmon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Planning"</a>, you’ll see how to use the triangle in more detail to build a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">statement of purpose</a><span class="glossdef">A tool for developing your purposes for a writing project, specifically your message, audience, voice, attitude, reception, and tone.</span></span> for specific writing projects by completing the following statements and returning to them as circumstances in your writing process change:</p>
