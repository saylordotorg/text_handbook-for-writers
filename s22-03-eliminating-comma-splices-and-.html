                <li>When you use a coordinating conjunction in a compound sentence, you should place a comma before the conjunction.</li>

Then write a comma splice and a fused sentence using the same pair of independent clauses. Finally, make one of the clauses dependent on the other, use a subordinating conjunction (see <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch16#mccrimmon-ch16">Chapter 16 "Sentence Style"</a>, <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch16_s03#mccrimmon-ch16_s03">Section 16.3 "Using Subordination and Coordination"</a>), and punctuate the sentence accordingly.</p>
