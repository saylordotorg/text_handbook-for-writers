But sometimes just coming up with a thesis requires research—and it should. Opinions are cheap; theses are not. Remember how important it is to be flexible; plans can change, and you need to be prepared for unexpected twists and turns during the research process. Making decisions about the issues in this chapter will give you a solid beginning toward conducting research that is meaningful to you and to your readers.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p02">If the assignment does not give you a clear idea of genre through the imperative verbs it uses, ask your instructor for some guidance. This being college, it’s possible that genre, like some other matters, is being left up to you. In such a scenario, the genre(s) you adopt will depend on what you decide about your purposes for writing. The truth is, genres blend into each other in real writing for real audiences. For example, how can you “take a position” about a social issue like teen pregnancy without doing some reporting and offering some solutions? How can you offer solutions to problems like climate change without first reporting on the severity of the problem, arguing for the urgency of the need for solutions, arguing that your solution is the best of several proposals, and finally arguing for your solution’s feasibility and cost effectiveness?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p03">Take the case of Jacoba, who is given the following <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">inquiry-based research</a><span class="glossdef">A type of assignment requiring exploration of a topic about which the student does not have a prior opinion.</span></span> assignment, a genre of academic writing that is becoming increasingly common at the college level:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p04">In an essay of at least twenty-five hundred words, I want you to explore a topic that means something to you but about which you do not yet have a clear opinion. Unlike other “research papers” you may have been asked to write in the past, you should <strong class="emphasis bold">not</strong> have a clear sense of your position or stance about your topic at the outset. Your research should be designed to develop your thinking about your topic, not to confirm an already held opinion, nor to find “straw men” who disagree with you and whose ideas you can knock down with ease.</p>
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p05">Make no mistake, by the end of this process, if you have chosen a topic about which you’re really curious and if you research with an open mind, you will have plenty to say. The final product may be submitted in any number of forms (possibilities include an interpretive report, a problem-solving proposal, a manifesto-like position statement) but it must be grounded in source work and it must demonstrate your ability to incorporate other voices into your work and to document them appropriately (using MLA standards). And like any other writing we have done in this course so far, you are responsible for determining the audiences you want to reach and the purposes you want to achieve.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p06">In this assignment, Jacoba and her classmates are intentionally given very little direct guidance and very few explicit instructions from their instructor about how to proceed. After some class discussion and some initial brainstorming on her own, she decides he wants to research and write about the crisis in solvency in Social Security. Prior to researching, she isn’t exactly sure how she feels about the issue, much less about an appropriate audience or purpose. She just knows she’s worried about her own aging parents and feels they deserve what’s coming to them. At the same time, she’s rankled that, in her early twenties, she has no expectation of ever seeing any of the money that’s been coming out of her paycheck every two weeks. The combination of uncertainty and interest she feels about the topic actually makes it ideal for this kind of inquiry-based research project.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s02_p07">Using the tips in <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch04#mccrimmon-ch04">Chapter 4 "Joining the Conversation"</a>, Jacoba puts together two preliminary statements of purpose intentionally at odds with each other.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Deciding How and Where You Will Research</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s03_p01">Although you might think that you can accomplish all of your research online from the comfort of your home, you should at least begin by visiting your school library. Talk to a research librarian about your planned paper and get his or her advice. You will likely learn about some in-library sources that would be helpful. But you will also probably discover some online sources and procedures that will be very beneficial. Another technique you can use for learning about research options is to talk to fellow students who have recently completed research projects. As always, you might be surprised what you can learn by such networking. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Primary sources</a><span class="glossdef">Firsthand source (e.g., in-person interviews and observations).</span></span>, such as in-person interviews and observations, can add an interesting dimension to a researched essay.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Selecting a Writing Venue</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s04_p01">Your writing venue might be predetermined for you. For example, you might be required to turn in a Microsoft Word file or you might be required to work on an online class site. Before you start, make sure you know how you will be presenting your final essay and if and how you are to present drafts along the way. Having to reroute your work along the way unnecessarily wastes time.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s05">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Setting Up a Method of Documenting Sources</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s05_p01">You will need to document your sources as you research since you clearly do not want to have to revisit any of your sources to retrieve documentation information. Although you can use the traditional method of creating numbered source cards to which you tie all notes you take, it makes much more sense to create digital note cards. Most college library databases include options for keeping a record of your sources. Using these tools can save you time and make the research process easier. Such sites also allow you to take notes and tie each note to one of the citations. Make sure to explore the services that are available to you. If you haven’t seen a college library database in some time, you will be pleasantly surprised at all the time-saving features they provide.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s05_p02">You can also create your version of digital note cards simply by making a file with numbered citations and coding your notes to the citations. If you choose, you can go online and find a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">citation builder</a><span class="glossdef">Online tool into which you can plug source information and receive a properly written citation in a chosen documentation style.</span></span> for assistance. Once you put a source’s information into the builder, you can copy and paste the citation into your citation file and into the citation list at the end of your paper. Your college library’s databases include tools that will help you build citations in American Psychological Association (APA), Modern Language Association (MLA), or other styles. Similar tools are also available with no college or university affiliation, but these tend to have ad content and can sometimes be less reliable. Another, less commercial option is an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">online writing lab (OWL)</a><span class="glossdef">A university-sponsored, ad-free, free-to-use site full of writing instructions.</span></span>. OWLs are college-level writing instruction sites managed by university writing programs and usually open to public use. The most famous and, according to many, still the best, is managed by the Purdue Writing Program: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://owl.english.purdue.edu">http://owl.english.purdue.edu</a>. Bookmark this site on your computer for the rest of your college career. You won’t regret it.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Determining Your Timeline</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p01">Begin with the amount of time you have to complete your project. Create a research and writing schedule that can realistically fit into your life and allow you to generate a quality product. Then stick with your plan. As with many time consuming tasks, if you fall off your schedule, you are likely to find yourself having to work long hours or having to make concessions in order to finish in time. Since such actions will probably result in an end product of lesser quality, making and keeping a schedule is an excellent idea.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p02">As a rule, when you make a schedule, it is best to plan to spend a little time each day as opposed to long blocks of time on a few days. Although, on a long project, you might find it beneficial to have some lengthy days, as a rule, long hours on a single project do not fit into one’s daily life very well.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p03">As you schedule your time, plan for at least one spare day before the project is due as sort of an insurance policy. In other words, don’t set your schedule to include working through the last available minute. A spare day or two gives you some flexibility in case the process doesn’t flow along perfectly according to your plan.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s06_p04">If you plan to have others proofread your work, respectfully consider their schedules. You can’t make a plan that requires others to drop what they are doing to read your draft on your schedule.</p>

    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s07">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Starting a Research Log to Track Your Ideas</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch07_s01_s07_p01">A research log is a great tool for keeping track of ideas that come to you while you are working. For example, you might think of another direction you want to pursue or find another source you want to follow up on. Since it is so easy to forget a fleeting but useful thought, keeping an ongoing log can be very helpful. The style or format of such a log will vary according to your personality. If you’re the type of person who likes to have a strict timeline, the log could be a chronologically arranged to-do list or even a series of alarms and reminders programmed into your cell phone. If, on the other hand, you’re a bit more conceptual or abstract in your thinking, keeping an up-to-date statement of purpose chart might be the way to go.</p>

                <li>When preparing to start a research paper, revisit your assignment to make sure you understand and remember all the guidelines.

In some cases, you may elect to use a mix of writing to inform, to interpret, to persuade, and to solve a problem.</li>
                <li>As a rule, you should begin your research with a meeting with a college librarian to make sure you are aware of your research options. Also, as you begin a research project, you have to decide whether you will use a simple word processing document or a more complex format, such as an online class site set up by your instructor. At the very beginning of a project, you should also make a plan for documenting your sources so that you are organized from the start.</li>
                <li>Based on the desired length of your essay and the amount of research you have to do, plan a realistic schedule that you can follow. Create a research log to keep track of information you want to remember and address as you research.</li>
