    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_p01">Varied sentences help create more interesting prose. Two key methods of varying your sentences are to use different starting techniques and to change the sentences from within. These two choices have some overlap, but for clarity, we’ll discuss them as separate options here.</p>
    <div class="section" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Avoiding “The…The…The”</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p01">You have all read “The…The…The” and “There…There…There” and “I…I…I” texts. When almost every sentence of a text begins exactly alike, it develops a boring and monotonous rhythm. As a rule, within a given paragraph, you should try to avoid starting more than two sentences with the same word.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p02">The need for varied sentence formats is a little less obvious but along the same lines. Even if you are starting all your sentences with different words, you could still fall into the trap of having every sentence use the same format, thus creating a similarly monotonous rhythm. Typical examples are sentences that all follow the simple subject format of subject–verb–object. Consider the sing-songy rhythm in this example:</p>
        <span class="blockquote block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_bl01">
            <p class="para editable" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p03">Rover had a bone. Princess wanted it. He snarled at Princess. She snarled at Rover. Princess looked to her left. Rover followed her eyes. Princess snatched the bone. Rover started barking.</p>
        </span>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p04">In the (rather extreme) example, no more than two sentences within the paragraph begin with the same word, but the sentence is still too rhythmic due to the similar format of each simple sentence.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s01_p05">One technique that will help you avoid using the same format is to make a conscious effort to vary your sentence constructions. Consider how the following formats provide interesting variation.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Varying from the Inside</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s02_p01">Along with changing the beginnings of sentences, you can add variety by combining sentences, adding words, expanding <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">descriptions</a><span class="glossdef">Depicting something so that readers can get a clear impression.</span></span> or ideas, and creating and moving clauses. Using all these techniques throughout a paper will create a nice mix of sentence formats.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Combining Sentences</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch06_s07_s02_s01_p01">Choosing exactly the right mix of sentence lengths can be challenging. If you use too many short sentences, your writing will be viewed as simplistic. If you use too many long sentences, your writing will be considered convoluted. Even if you use all medium-length sentences, your writing might be dubbed as monotonous. The trick is to use a variety of sentence lengths. If you find you have too many short, choppy sentences, you can combine some of them to add a little variety.</p>
