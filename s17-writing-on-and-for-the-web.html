        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s00_p01">The digital world has permanently altered written communication. Copying and pasting ease the sharing and transferring of large blocks of text. Independent and joint editing of text is much easier and much less time consuming. Searching for specific parts of a long text is quick and easy. Checking for plagiarism takes only a few seconds. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Multimodal compositions</a><span class="glossdef">An emerging type of composition that incorporates a variety of modes of delivery (e.g., audio or visual content) into written material.</span></span> can be created by incorporating visual and auditory material into written texts.

    </div>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s01_p01">Both as a student and in other aspects of your life, you are likely to write information and publish it on the Internet. Some examples of possible Internet writing that many people take part in are chat rooms, social networking sites like Facebook, voice over Internet protocol (VOIP) platforms like Skype, e-mail, mobile cellular texts, online distance-learning coursework (such as assignments, group projects, and discussion forums), blogs and responses to blogs, instant messages, wikis, nonacademic discussion forums, web-based memorial sites, responses to online newspaper articles, and job applications. Given that few of these media or genres existed a generation ago, it’s patently absurd to argue that “people don’t write (or read) anymore,” and it’s difficult to argue that writing teachers shouldn’t try to account for what’s at stake when you write on and for the web.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s01_p02">Like every other kind of written communication, how you write on the web depends on the purpose of the specific situation. In reality, you’ve probably developed a pretty good system for running your web-based communication through an almost unconscious version of the statement of purpose questions from <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05#mccrimmon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Planning"</a>. If you have an unlimited text plan and maintain at least one profile on a social networking site, you concern yourself with matters of voice, message, audience, tone, attitude, and reception hundreds of times a day. At the very least, students and teachers ought to be trying to learn together how to apply or translate the sophisticated rhetorical strategies you use in your casual communication to your more serious academic and professional endeavors.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s01_p03">Because you are often multitasking while texting or using the web and because of the speed and convenience of electronic communication, this realm is prone to carelessness. In casual situations, rules are minimal and you can use very casual language that includes abbreviations, slang, and shortcuts. Your use of a casual tone depends solely on whether your audience will understand what you are saying. Writing for school or work does not fall into the casual category. In these situations, you cannot use abbreviations, slang, and shortcuts. In fact, you need to use proper punctuation, grammar, and capitalization. You should also use traditional writing rules and a more formal tone when responding to diverse populations and serious situations.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s01_p04">Whether writing in a casual or formal situation, always be aware of the population that has access to your content. Also keep in mind that even if you are writing on a semiprivate venue like a class-wide course management system or on an invitation-only wiki, your digital text can easily be copied by someone with access and forwarded to someone without access. So don’t write anything that could embarrass or cause problems for you or others.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s01_p05">Due to the nonprivate nature of the Internet, you should not provide full contact information. Depending on the situation, you might choose to use your full name (such as in an online class or on a memorial condolence site) or you might choose to use a pseudonym (such as in a response to a blog or to an online newspaper article). Only give your phone number and address when you are on very secure sites. Never post your social security number online. If you have a legitimate request for your social security number, call and give it over the telephone.</p>

Whether you create a site to supplement a résumé, to serve as a common, virtual family meeting place, or to showcase individual or collaborative work you’ve done for a class, you should follow some basic guidelines to make sure your website is aesthetically pleasing and well organized, so that it functions well and accomplishes its purpose.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making a Website Aesthetically Pleasing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s02_s01_p01">Use relevant photos, graphics, and font variations to give your site interest. Leave plenty of white space. A crowded web page is not inviting. Use an easily readable font and font size with ample leading. Small tight text is hard to read and many Internet searchers will skip such a site and move on to the abundance of other choices. Take care when choosing background and font colors. Make sure your background does not engulf the text making it hard to read. As a rule, make your background light and your text dark. Take care when choosing background effects. A very busy background can detract from your content.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s02_s02_p01">Plan for little or no scrolling. Instead include clearly marked navigation links to move to different parts of the information. Include navigation links to all parts of the website from all pages so a person never feels stuck on a page. Design an overall look that holds from page to page to give your website consistency. Use an easily recognizable format for navigation links so that they clearly stand out.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s02_s03_p01">Use images that are between forty and one hundred kilobytes to ensure clear images that are easily and quickly loaded on most people’s computers. Since one hundred kilobytes is the maximum suggested size, you will have your best luck if you stay well below that level. Match your level of use of technology tools to your needs. Don’t add features just to try to make your site impressive. Remember that the more features you add, the more likely it is that someone will have trouble with your site. Some people’s computers will have trouble with very involved opening pages that include audio and video. If you choose such an opening page, also include an override button for people who can’t or don’t want to view the opening page. Make sure all the links and paths are very obvious and that they all work smoothly.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Making a Website Accomplish Its Purpose</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s02_s04_p01">Make sure the home page is uncluttered and clearly states the purpose of the website. This is the main chance you have of attracting attention. Make the website as visual as possible. The more quickly a person can glance through web content, the more likely the person is to take in the information. You can make a site visual by including subheadings that stand out, relevant images, short blocks of text, white space between blocks of text, and numbered or bulleted lists. Keep the website up to date. Depending on the content and purpose of the website, keeping it up to date could be a daily, weekly, or monthly chore. Consider that a site that is out of date ceases to be visited. Include a contact link so viewers can reach you. Remember that anyone with Internet can access your site. Take care with the information you post. Always assume that your instructors, employers, parents, or friends will see it.</p>

In education, students are often asked to collaborate online to discuss course readings, to work on group projects, or to edit each other’s work. In business, employees often work together online to brainstorm and develop ideas and projects. The online environment allows people who are in different physical locations to work together virtually. In addition, online collaboration sites allow everyone to keep track of each participant’s contributions.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s01_p01">Technology has introduced a whole array of platforms and tools for group projects. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Course management systems</a><span class="glossdef">A web-based learning environment that organizes the work of a course (e.g., Blackboard).</span></span>, such as Moodle, Blackboard, or eCampus, tend to excel as spaces to post course materials and external links, to conduct <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">group discussion boards</a><span class="glossdef">A digital space for brief posts and responses by a group of students, usually set up in a course management system by the instructor.</span></span>, to provide for electronic submission of essays, and to manage records like grades, calendars, announcements, and deadlines.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s01_p02">The following is an example of how a richer kind of threaded small-group class discussion about possible connections between video games and violent behavior can be conducted online, even in a face-to-face class. This discussion was conducted after each of the seven students in a writing group had posted their initial response to a couple of opposing readings on the subject. In order to keep the online conversation going, the students were asked to respond to at least one group member’s initial post, using the following questions:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>What patterns do you notice about your group members’ or classmates’ responses to the readings?</li>

            <li>What are any possible clarifications and interpretations of specific moments from texts that group members or classmates seem to be having trouble with?</li>
            <li>Which texts (or which aspects of texts) still warrant special attention before the class moves on to the next unit of assigned readings? Be specific about what you want your group members or classmates to discuss. What additional questions do you have about the readings?</li>

Think about how the debate progressed in this online environment, and consider how it might have operated differently if conducted face-to-face in a traditional, oral class discussion.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s01_l02">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Bill:</strong> In response to Amber’s post: Do you think that violence in video games causes the violent action or do you think that it just adds fuel to the fire? I play violent video games, but I don’t go around hitting people and blowing things up. I was in the Marines for the last five years and never shot anyone. So my belief is that these people are already messed up in the head. I think the lack of morals in teens comes from parents not being able to punish their children as they see fit resulting in a generation of misbehaved misfits who have grown up undisciplined. My suggestion would be for parents to monitor their children’s use of video games and explain the difference between games and real life.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Amber:</strong> As I read other people’s posts I see most people say no. Well I still stand by my opinion on the whole thing. I didn’t say that everyone who plays violent video games will make them a violent person. I just think that violent video games have the potential to play a role in children’s minds today in the United States. Not every person who plays these violent video games will have a negative effect on their minds. I don’t think that people should stop playing violent video games, but I do think that young children today should not play them as much or until they are old enough. I will always think that violent video games will lead to violence in a child’s mind because they see it on these games played.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Adam:</strong> Having read other students’ posts, I can tell that there are those who say yes and those who say no, but to those who say yes I have to ask, Would you rather someone release their anger and rage on real people or virtual avatars that have no feelings, have no sense of pain, feel no fear, or anything? All I’m asking is, If there are going to be people with violent behaviors, would you rather the result be virtual or real?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Brandy:</strong> I noticed that several of my other group members noticed the lack of concrete evidence on the yes side of the argument. Two of them, I believe, brought up something that I had forgotten could be possible. It may be that violent games children play bring out the violent and aggressive side in them that already existed but lay somewhat dormant, for lack of a better description. I can’t imagine a mentally stable child being driven out of his or her balanced mind-set of some sort of common sense and morality and a distinction between reality and a virtual world simply and solely by a violent game. If anything I believe it would, as Jamal said, “desensitize a person,” but not turn that child into an aggressive child.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Malcolm:</strong> Violent video games will be a problem when presented to individuals who already have a problem waiting to come out. A hundred years ago, without video games around, there was still influence from books to trigger acts of violence. Not everyone that read books found the desire to act violently, but some people found glorification of violence in books, enough for it to suggest to them that it was the right thing to do. This is no different from video games today.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Jamal:</strong> As my classmate, Amber, brought up, there could be a negative impact on young children. My thought, though, is that the level of reality that the game takes on could be a factor. Games that are trying very hard to look real and have all the lifelike components of war, gang life, or even mercenaries could be a little over the top for some ages. It is the same reason you do not let an eight-year-old watch <em class="emphasis">SAW</em> or something like that. They are unable to process that kind of information without having a nightmare or at least looking under the bed.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Becky:</strong> After reflecting more on the issue, and everyone’s responses, I’m also unable to say yes or no to the argument. I still don’t see any value to these kinds of games and think they serve no positive purpose, but I can’t confidently say that violent video games lead directly to violent actions. There are just too many other factors that require recognition. Just as the no responses claim that those committing violent acts are already “messed up” and cannot differentiate between right and wrong because they were not taught so, the same idea can be flipped to suggest that violent video players who were taught certain values will not commit violent acts. Where is the control group? I don’t see how either side can present a solid story with so many variables.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s01_p04">Because course management systems are not really designed for collaborative composition courses, they’re not really ideal for group writing projects. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Wikis</a><span class="glossdef">An interactive, shared website featuring content that can be edited by many users.</span></span>, another type of collaborative technology tool, are beginning to replace course management systems for certain kinds of collaboration because they can make group work much more convenient, visible, and meaningful. Professors can set up a wiki as a free online collaborative platform that offers workspace for class-wide group or individual projects. Within a site, individuals can have private workspaces to which other students do not have access unless the site “owner” invites them. Students can use a wiki to gather notes and compile a writing project from beginning to end. Within a wiki, students can save all versions of a draft allowing for retrieval of previous information. Being able to save different versions also allows multiple students to edit, for example, Pete’s draft so that Pete can then access all the edits and choose the changes he wishes to make.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s01_p05">Since each student has a private log-in and password, wikis can easily keep track of who made what changes and when the changes were made. You can even use the settings on your wiki account to have it send you an e-mail whenever someone adds something to your space. Students and teachers can also upload files and place links on the wiki to relevant materials elsewhere on the Internet, such as to an American Psychological Association (APA) or Modern Language Association (MLA) citation builder.

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s02_p01">Group work is often lopsided and unfair—a few tend to do most of the work. <strong class="emphasis bold">Do your fair share.</strong> You would be ill advised to try shirking your part of the work in an online situation since the collaboration program will keep track of each participant’s contributions.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s02_p02">Most sites will maintain all versions of a document or file being drafted collaboratively. As a rule, you should always work in the most current version unless the group mutually decides to revert to a previous version.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s02_p03">Determine which group member is best able to complete different technology aspects of the project, such as scanning, uploading, and creating diagrams. If all members of the group are expected to perform certain technological tasks, make sure the learning curve is not too steep by writing explicit directions. Discussing such aspects up front will make the project go more smoothly.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s03_p01">If the group seems to be going around in circles, consider a conference call (over the computer or by telephone). With an in-person (or at least <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">synchronous</a><span class="glossdef">Taking place at the same time.</span></span>) conversation, you can often straighten out issues that are difficult to handle through chains of e-mails.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s03_p02">On the other hand, if you need to talk to only one member of the group, do so through e-mail. Save the group site for communication intended for the whole group.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s03_s03_p03">Keep in mind that written words do not include voice intonations or facial expressions and are thus more easily misunderstood than are in-person spoken words. If a group member’s comment strikes you the wrong way, give the person the benefit of the doubt instead of being defensive.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">General Portfolio Guidelines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s04_s01_p01">As with any other kind of communication, base your portfolio planning on your reasons for building one. Run the portfolio through the statement of purpose questions from <a class="xref" href="mccrimmon-ch05#mccrimmon-ch05">Chapter 5 "Planning"</a>. For example, you might design a portfolio to apply for admission or scholarships to colleges, to apply for a job, to network with other professionals in your field, to complete a school assignment, to collect your artistic work, or to explore a personal interest. The following guidelines are useful for all portfolios, regardless of whether they are designed to meet an academic, professional, aesthetic, or social purpose:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Consider carefully your choices of what to include (known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">artifacts</a><span class="glossdef">An individual piece in a portfolio.</span></span>) and choose those that showcase the most impressive variety of your skills. If you are a writer, showcase different writing skills or a progression in the development of your writing skills (showing “before” and “after” drafts). If you are a salesperson, showcase different types of sales accomplishments.</li>
            <li>Keep the number of choices under ten in an employment portfolio so that a prospective employer could reasonably look at all the options. If you have multiple categories, such as writing samples, work accomplishments, and volunteer experiences, you could consider having up to ten items within each category.</li>
            <li>Read through all the choices to make sure you are 100-percent pleased about the content. Do not rely on memory to tell you that an item is OK to use.</li>
            <li>Label and date each selection.</li>
            <li>Create an explanation of each chosen item.</li>
            <li>Make sure all your selected items are free of errors.</li>
            <li>Arrange your selections from most to least impressive unless you have a reason to arrange them differently, such as in chronological order, keeping in mind that someone might start through your portfolio and not finish it.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Electronic Portfolio Guidelines</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s04_s02_p01">Follow these guidelines to take better advantage of the forms, functions, and features an online environment can bring to portfolios:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch13_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Create an introductory page with <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">links</a><span class="glossdef">A clickable text or image that is placed within digital text and has the ability to reroute you to another location; short for hyperlink.</span></span> to the other pages. Make sure the introductory page is short enough to minimize scrolling.</li>
            <li>Consider establishing or incorporating some kind of social presence (perhaps with an appropriate photo or with an audio or video greeting) on the introductory page. Make sure your tone (the relationship between your portfolio’s voice and your audience) achieves an appropriate level of formality, depending on the working relationship you already have with your audience.</li>
            <li>Include a one-line description of each link as a preintroduction to the portfolio item when you list the links on the introductory page.</li>
            <li>Choose whether to include <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">multimedia</a><span class="glossdef">Content made up of more than one medium (e.g., text, images, audio, and video).</span></span> pieces, such as video and audio clips, depending on the capabilities of the site where you are posting your portfolio.</li>
            <li>Convert each page or file to a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">PDF file</a><span class="glossdef">A digital file format where all components are locked in place; short for portable document file.</span></span> or a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">JPEG</a><span class="glossdef">A digital image format that is compatible with many software formats; an acronym for Joint Photographic Experts Group.</span></span> so that you can be assured that the formatting will remain fixed. After you create each PDF file or JPEG, open it to make sure it converted properly.</li>
            <li>Traverse your e-portfolio thoroughly when you’re finished building it to check out all the links and make sure everything is working and looks OK. Then ask a friend to do the same on a different computer. Ideally you should road test the portfolio from both a PC and a Mac platform. By road testing, you are effectively anticipating your portfolio’s reception (the relationship between your audience and the message you are conveying).</li>
            <li>Include a link to a self-profile as well as a link to your résumé.</li>
            <li>Keep your e-portfolio up to date. This task is especially important if your e-portfolio is posted where others can access it without your knowledge.</li>

You can use links to organize a page, to save space on a page, to add interest to your text, to incorporate someone else’s ideas into your work, to provide conveniences for your reader, and to complement text in other creative ways. Most often, links are in blue font that is underlined once or twice. You can, however, choose to present links in other ways, such as by using buttons, images, or nonunderlined text.
