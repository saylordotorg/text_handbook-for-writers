In its purest form, an abbreviation includes initial letters of a word followed by a period, such as “in.” for “inches.” However, many abbreviations skip over letters, such as “yd.” for “yard,” and are still written with a period. Some multiword terms are abbreviated by using the first letter of each word and are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">acronyms</a><span class="glossdef">A multiword term that is abbreviated by using the first letter of each word.</span></span> rather than abbreviations. An example of an acronym is “FBI” for “Federal Bureau of Investigation.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_p02">Some abbreviations or acronyms require a period (etc.), but quite a few never take periods (IBM or FBI). You simply have to learn these differences through the experience of seeing specific examples in print.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_p03">You need to know two main things about abbreviations: when to use them and how to write them appropriately. The following sections will clarify these two points.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Abbreviations with Numbers</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_s03_p01">Some abbreviations are used almost exclusively to describe or clarify numbers. These abbreviations should not be used as stand-alone abbreviations. In other words, you can use the dollar-sign abbreviation to write “$5.00” but not to write “I earned several $ last night.” Some of these abbreviations can be used within text, such as BC, p.m., and CST. Measurement abbreviations, however, should be used only in tables, graphs, and figures and should be spelled out within continuous text. Some of these abbreviations will be addressed as symbols later in this section.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Topic- or Profession-Specific and Incident-Specific Abbreviations</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_s05_p01">If you are writing for an audience that is familiar with a specific vocabulary that incorporates abbreviations—for example, readers with a strong military base—you can use those abbreviations freely. But be aware when you are writing for readers who do not share that common knowledge base that you will have to spell out abbreviations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="mccrimmon-ch19_s03_s05_p02">Incident-specific abbreviations are created for use in one specific situation and thus require obvious references so the audience can understand their meaning. For example, say you are writing a story about a teacher named Mr. Nieweldowskilty. If you refer to him by his full name once and then note that students call him Mr. Niews for short and then refer to him as Mr. Niews the rest of the time, your audience can easily understand that Mr. Niews is short for Mr. Nieweldowskilty. But if you write a second story about him, you cannot assume that readers will know the abbreviated name, Mr. Niews.</p>
